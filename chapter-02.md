# Chapter 2: Precision and Pressure

Measure thirty-seven, third beat. The shift was wrong again.

Nathan Brooks lowered his violin, jaw tight with frustration. He'd played this passage from the Sibelius Violin Concerto seventeen times in the last forty minutes, and the shift from third position to fifth was still imprecise. Not wrong, exactly. Anyone else might not notice. But he noticed, and that meant it wasn't good enough.

He raised the violin again, settling it under his chin with the unconscious familiarity of thirteen years of practice. Bow poised over the strings. Deep breath. Again.

The notes emerged clean and controlled, technically accurate. The shift approached. His left hand moved up the fingerboard, and—there. Still a fraction of a second too slow, the movement visible instead of seamless. Anyone watching would see his hand travel. Audition panels would see it. Conservatory professors would see it.

Unacceptable.

Nathan set the violin down and reached for the practice journal he kept in his case. September 12th, Practice Session 3B, 5:00-7:00 PM, Sibelius Concerto, Movement 1. He noted: "M. 37-40: position shifts need work. Slow practice, isolate technical issue."

Four months until auditions. Four months to achieve perfection in three major concerto movements, two Bach sonatas, and showpiece etudes. Four months to prove he deserved a spot at a top conservatory, that eighteen years of his life had been leading somewhere meaningful.

Four months to avoid failure.

He checked his watch. Six-fifteen. Forty-five minutes left in his scheduled practice block. He could drill the problematic passage fifty more times if he stayed focused.

Nathan set the journal aside and picked up his violin again. Measure thirty-seven. Again.

The knock on the practice room door came at six-thirty, interrupting his twenty-third attempt.

"It's open," Nathan called, lowering his bow.

Ethan Wolfe pushed the door open, cello case strapped to his back, easygoing grin already in place. "You've been playing the same four measures for the last fifteen minutes. I could hear you from the hallway."

"The shift isn't clean."

"It sounds fine to me."

"It's not fine." Nathan turned back to his music stand, hoping Ethan would take the hint.

He didn't. Ethan came into the practice room and leaned against the wall, settling in like he planned to stay. "There's a group going into town for dinner. Martinez, Chen, and a few others. We're leaving in twenty minutes if you want to come."

"I have practice until seven."

"You have this room reserved until seven. There's a difference."

Nathan set his violin in its open case, reaching for his rosin. "I need to work on this passage."

"You need to eat. And maybe remember that humans occasionally do things besides practice."

"I'll eat after. There's a sandwich in my dorm room."

Ethan sighed, the familiar sound of someone who'd had this conversation before. They'd been studio partners since sophomore year, assigned to the same practice corridor, scheduled for the same chamber music sessions. Ethan was talented—genuinely talented—but he approached music with a casualness Nathan couldn't comprehend. He practiced enough to be good, but he also had friends, hobbies, a life beyond the practice room.

Nathan had auditions.

"When's the last time you did something that wasn't on your practice schedule?" Ethan asked.

"Last Sunday. I went to the library."

"To study music theory."

"It's a legitimate use of time."

"Nathan." Ethan's voice shifted, losing its teasing edge. "I'm not saying you shouldn't practice. You're incredibly dedicated, and that's impressive. But you're also eighteen years old. It's okay to have dinner with friends occasionally."

Nathan focused on rosining his bow, the familiar scratch of horsehair against hardened tree sap. "The Juilliard pre-screening audition is in January. Curtis is in February. New England Conservatory in early March. If I don't get into one of those programs, the last eighteen years of my life will have been wasted."

"That's not true."

"Yes, it is." Nathan set the rosin down. "My parents have supported this since I was five years old. Private lessons twice a week, summer music festivals, this boarding school specifically for its music program. They've invested everything in preparing me for conservatory."

"They invested in you because they love you, not because they need a return on investment."

"You don't understand."

Ethan was quiet. "Maybe I don't. But you've forgotten why you started playing in the first place."

The words stung more than Nathan wanted to admit. He turned back to his music stand. "I should get back to practice."

"Right." Ethan pushed away from the wall. "The dinner offer stands if you change your mind. We'll be at that Italian place on Main Street."

"Thanks, but I'm fine."

After Ethan left, Nathan picked up his violin again. The practice room felt quieter than before, the soundproofed walls absorbing even the ambient noise that usually bled through from the hallway.

He didn't let himself think about Ethan's words. Thinking led to doubt, and doubt led to hesitation, and hesitation led to mistakes. Better to focus on what he could control: technique, precision, preparation.

Measure thirty-seven. Again.

By six-fifty, his left hand ached and his shoulder had developed the familiar knot of tension that came from extended practice sessions. The shift was better—smoother, less visible—but still not perfect. He made notes in his practice journal, packed his violin carefully in its case, and checked his appearance in the small mirror on the practice room wall.

Neat. Presentable. The navy blazer and khakis he'd worn to classes looked slightly rumpled, but acceptably so. He ran a hand through his dark hair, pushing it back from his forehead.

His phone buzzed with a reminder: Assembly, 7:00 PM, Willoughby Hall.

Right. The interdisciplinary collaboration project Professor Reeves had been mentioning. Nathan had been dreading this announcement for weeks.

Collaboration meant working with someone outside the music department. Someone whose training, standards, and work ethic might be completely different from his own. Someone who might want to improvise or experiment instead of following a carefully structured plan.

Someone who might introduce variables he couldn't control.

Nathan gathered his violin case and practice journal, turned off the lights, and headed toward Willoughby Hall. The September evening was still warm, the campus pathways filled with students making their way to the assembly. He walked alone, as usual, violin case in hand.

He'd chosen Blackwood Academy specifically for its music program. The school had an excellent conservatory preparation track, rigorous private instruction, and a reputation for sending students to top music programs. The academics were solid, the facilities excellent, and most importantly, the environment was serious and focused.

Or it had been, until now.

Interdisciplinary collaboration. The phrase alone made Nathan's shoulders tense. Art and music didn't mix well—one was visual and spatial, the other temporal and auditory. Forcing them together seemed artificial, a gimmick designed to look innovative without serving either discipline properly.

But Professor Reeves taught his Advanced Music Theory class, and her opinion mattered for conservatory recommendations. He couldn't afford to dismiss the project, even if the concept made him uncomfortable.

Nathan reached Willoughby Hall at seven-oh-five, five minutes late despite his best intentions. The assembly had already started, rows of seats filled with students. He slipped in through the back entrance and found a spot standing against the wall.

Professor Reeves was on the small stage, mid-explanation. "—will be paired with a student from a different artistic discipline. Your assignment is to create a collaborative performance piece that will be showcased at our winter arts festival in mid-November."

Six weeks. Not much time to coordinate schedules, develop a concept, and produce something performance-ready. Nathan's practice schedule was already packed. He'd have to find time for collaboration meetings without sacrificing audition preparation.

"These partnerships are assigned, not chosen," Professor Reeves continued.

Nathan's stomach sank. Assigned meant no control over who he'd work with. He might get paired with someone serious and professional, or he might get someone who treated art as self-expression instead of disciplined craft.

He scanned the crowd from his position in the back, trying to assess potential partners. The visual arts students sat in one section, most of them dressed casually, several with visible paint stains. The theater students were scattered throughout, identifiable by their theatrical gestures and animated conversations. Dance students clustered together near the front, posture perfect even sitting down.

Near the middle section, a girl turned to whisper something to her friend. Her hands were gesturing expressively, and even from a distance, Nathan could see paint smudges on her fingers. She had dark hair pulled back messily, and she wore jeans and a tank top that looked like they'd survived multiple studio sessions.

Something about her energy—animated, unselfconscious—made Nathan instinctively wary. She looked like the kind of person who created chaos and called it art.

He looked away.

"The project represents twenty percent of your semester grade," Professor Reeves said, her voice carrying clearly across the hall. "You're expected to meet regularly with your partner, develop a cohesive artistic vision, and present a completed piece at the showcase. This isn't optional, and there are no reassignments except for medical emergencies."

Twenty percent. Significant enough to matter for his GPA, which mattered for applications. Nathan made a mental note to check partnership assignments first thing tomorrow and reach out immediately to establish a meeting schedule.

Whoever he got paired with, he'd make it work. He'd approach it like any other project: create a detailed plan, establish clear objectives, execute with precision. Keep the emotional investment minimal and the technical execution high.

Art might be subjective, but collaboration could still be controlled.

Professor Reeves dismissed them with encouraging words about innovation and growth. The hall erupted in conversation as students stood and filed toward the exits. Nathan waited for the crowd to thin before making his way out, avoiding the clusters of animated discussion.

Back in his dorm room, he updated his practice schedule for the coming week, blocking out time for the collaboration project. Two evenings, maybe three, depending on his partner's availability. Enough to fulfill the project requirements without compromising audition preparation.

His roommate was out—probably at that Italian dinner Ethan had mentioned. The quiet was welcome. Nathan pulled out tomorrow's practice music, reviewing the passages that needed work.

Measure thirty-seven still bothered him.

He picked up his violin, not bothering with the practice room this time. His roommate wouldn't be back for hours. Just a few minutes of work before bed, targeting that specific technical issue.

As he played, he tried not to think about Ethan's words. About forgotten joy or lost passion. Music wasn't about joy. It was about excellence, achievement, proving that years of work had produced something worthwhile.

And in four months, he'd prove it.

If nothing—including this collaboration project—got in his way.
