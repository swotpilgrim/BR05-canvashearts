# Chapter 3: Unwelcome Partnerships

"Partnership assignments are as follows," Professor Reeves said, consulting the paper in her hand. "Please listen carefully. I'll only read through once."

I sat up straighter, suddenly very aware of my heartbeat. Around the assembly hall, the ambient noise dropped to absolute silence. This was it.

"Chen and Foster—music composition and dance." Professor Reeves's voice carried clearly across the space. "Martinez and Williams—sculpture and theater."

Names continued. I didn't know most of the people being called, but each pairing sent a small wave of relief through me. Not me yet. Still hope for someone compatible.

"Clarke and Patterson—theater and photography."

Madison grabbed my hand and squeezed. She'd gotten photography, which wasn't ideal but workable. I squeezed back, happy for her, still waiting.

"Lawson and Brooks—visual arts and music."

My stomach dropped.

Brooks. Nathan Brooks. The violin guy who always looked like he'd swallowed something bitter. The one who practiced with the intensity of someone defusing a bomb. The music student I'd noticed at dinner earlier, sitting with his equally serious peers, probably discussing the technical complexities of some baroque composer.

I twisted in my seat, scanning the back of the hall where I'd seen him standing during Professor Reeves's introduction. He was still there, partially obscured by other students, but I caught a glimpse of his expression.

He looked exactly as horrified as I felt.

Perfect. We hadn't even met officially, and we were already in agreement about one thing: this partnership was a disaster.

Professor Reeves continued reading names, but I stopped listening. My brain was too busy cycling through everything I knew about Nathan Brooks, which admittedly wasn't much. Senior, like me. Music scholarship, I thought, or maybe merit-based. Always alone, always carrying that violin case like it contained something precious and fragile. Always looking intense and focused and completely unapproachable.

We couldn't be more different if we'd tried.

I painted with chaos and energy and emotion. He probably color-coded his sheet music and had opinions about proper bow tension.

This was going to be a nightmare.

"Remember," Professor Reeves said as the last names were read, "these partnerships are designed to challenge you. Embrace the discomfort. Some of the most innovative art emerges from unlikely collaborations."

Easy for her to say. She wasn't the one who had to figure out how to make visual spontaneity work with musical precision.

The assembly dismissed, and the hall erupted into conversation. Students immediately found their assigned partners, some excited, others clearly apprehensive. I stayed in my seat, watching Nathan Brooks at the back of the hall. He wasn't moving either, just standing there with his violin case, looking like he was contemplating every bad decision that had led him to this moment.

Madison appeared in front of me. "Okay, so Nathan Brooks. That's... music, right?"

"Violin." I finally stood up. "He's one of those intense classical musician types."

"You don't actually know him."

"I've observed him. That counts."

"Observing someone in the dining hall doesn't tell you anything about how they collaborate." Madison linked her arm through mine, steering me toward the exit. "Maybe he's actually nice."

"He looks like someone who thinks fun is a sign of weak character."

"Sienna."

"What? I'm being realistic. We have completely opposite approaches to art. This is going to be six weeks of arguing about whether structure or spontaneity matters more."

We emerged into the September evening, the air cooler now that the sun had set. Other students clustered on the pathways, already making plans with their new partners. I saw Madison's partner—Chris Patterson from the photography department—wave at her from across the quad.

"I should go talk to him," Madison said. "Are you going to be okay?"

"I'm fine. It's just one project. How bad can it be?"

Madison gave me a look that suggested she knew exactly how bad it could be but was too polite to say so. "Come find me later if you need to vent."

"I will definitely need to vent."

She laughed and headed toward Chris, leaving me alone on the pathway. I glanced back toward Willoughby Hall, but Nathan had disappeared. Probably already making a color-coded schedule for our collaboration, planning every second of every meeting with military precision.

I walked back to the dorm slowly, my earlier excitement about the project completely deflated. I'd been imagining working with another painter, someone who understood the visual language I spoke. Or a dancer, someone who moved with the same kind of instinctive energy I painted with.

Instead, I got someone who probably thought art was about hitting the right notes at the right time, with no room for interpretation or feeling.

Back in my room, I changed out of my dinner clothes into paint-stained sweats and tried to work on my portfolio piece. But I couldn't focus. Every time I picked up a brush, I imagined Nathan Brooks standing in my studio, looking at my spontaneous process with barely concealed disapproval.

The image was so vivid: him standing there with his violin case, arms crossed, watching me paint with that intense expression I'd seen at dinner. Mentally cataloging everything I was doing wrong. Too much emotion, not enough technique. Too chaotic, not enough structure.

I set the brush down, frustrated with myself. I didn't even know this guy. For all I knew, he could be perfectly pleasant and open to collaboration.

"You're spiraling," I said aloud. "You haven't even met him yet. Maybe it'll be fine."

But I didn't believe it. That note—the stiff formality—told me everything I needed to know.

At nine-thirty, Madison returned from her meeting with Chris, looking cheerful. "He's really nice! We already have some ideas for combining photography and performance. This might actually be fun."

"I'm happy for you," I said from my position on the floor, where I'd been sitting for the last twenty minutes staring at a blank canvas.

"Have you heard from Nathan yet?"

"No. Why would I?"

"Most people are reaching out to their partners tonight to set up first meetings."

"Maybe he's hoping if he ignores it, the partnership will dissolve."

"Or maybe he's nervous and doesn't know how to approach you." Madison sat on her bed, tucking her legs under her. "You're both going into this assuming the worst. What if you're wrong?"

"I'm not wrong. I've seen him around campus. He's all structure and control and perfectionism. That's the opposite of everything I believe about making art."

"So teach him something. Let him teach you something. Isn't that the point of collaboration?"

I wanted to argue, but Madison had that reasonable tone that made disagreement feel petty. "I just wanted to work with someone who already spoke my artistic language."

"That would be comfortable. Professor Reeves specifically said this project is about pushing us outside comfort zones."

"I hate it when you're right."

"I know." Madison grinned. "Want to watch a movie? Take your mind off it?"

"Yeah, okay."

We set up Madison's laptop and started some romantic comedy neither of us had seen before. I tried to pay attention, but my brain kept wandering back to the collaboration. Twenty percent of my grade. Six weeks of working with someone who probably thought my art was undisciplined chaos.

I must have fallen asleep during the movie, because the next thing I knew, Madison was shaking me awake.

"Sienna. Someone slipped something under our door."

I blinked, disoriented. The laptop screen showed the movie's menu, the room was dark except for Madison's desk lamp, and I was still on the floor where I'd been sitting.

"What time is it?"

"Almost eleven."

Madison handed me a folded piece of paper—actual stationery, the nice kind with a subtle watermark. I unfolded it, immediately recognizing the neat, precise handwriting.

*First meeting Monday 7pm, Practice Room 3B. Please be punctual. -Nathan Brooks*

I read it twice. The formality was almost impressive. No "hey" or "looking forward to working together." Just facts: day, time, location, expectation.

"Please be punctual," I read aloud. "Who writes like this?"

"Someone who values organization?"

"Someone who's going to drive me absolutely insane." I folded the note and set it on my desk. "Practice Room 3B. Of course he wants to meet on his territory."

"Maybe he has equipment there he needs for the project."

"Or maybe he wants home-field advantage." I stood up, stretching muscles stiff from sitting on the floor. "Fine. Monday at seven. I'll be there. I'll be punctual. I'll be professional."

"You'll be defensive," Madison said knowingly.

"Probably," I admitted. "But I'll also be prepared to make this work, even if he's the most rigid, controlling, joyless musician at Blackwood."

"That's the spirit. Sort of."

I got ready for bed, but sleep didn't come easily. I kept thinking about Monday's meeting, playing out different scenarios in my head. All of them ended in arguments about artistic vision and creative process.

Maybe I was being unfair. Maybe Nathan Brooks was actually a lovely human being who would appreciate spontaneous artistic expression.

But that note—*please be punctual*—suggested otherwise.

I rolled over, staring at the ceiling of our dorm room. Madison's breathing had already settled into sleep rhythms, but I was wide awake, anxiety mixing with frustration mixing with something that might have been curiosity.

What kind of music did he play? I'd heard violin coming from the practice wing before, but I'd never stopped to listen. Classical, obviously—everyone in Blackwood's music program studied classical technique. But was he technically good? Emotionally expressive? Or just mechanically perfect, hitting every note with precision but no soul?

And more importantly, how were we possibly going to create something meaningful together when we clearly approached art from completely opposite directions? I thrived on spontaneity and instinct. He probably had every measure of his life planned three months in advance.

The collaboration was supposed to combine our art forms—painting and music. But what did that even look like? Me painting while he played? Him playing while I tried to create something responsive? The whole concept felt artificial, forced, like we were being asked to speak two different languages simultaneously and somehow produce coherent communication.

Twenty percent of my grade. I couldn't fail this project, no matter how incompatible we were.

Which meant I had to find a way to work with Nathan Brooks, rigid formality and all. I had to walk into that practice room on Monday evening, set aside my preconceptions, and at least try to be professional.

Even if every instinct told me this collaboration was doomed before it started.

I finally fell asleep sometime after midnight, my last conscious thought being Monday at seven, Practice Room 3B.

At least I knew where to direct my frustration when the inevitable disaster began.
