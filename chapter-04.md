# Chapter 4: First Impressions, Last Hopes

I arrived at Practice Room 3B at exactly seven o'clock Monday evening, determined not to give Nathan Brooks any ammunition for criticism. If he wanted punctuality, he'd get punctuality.

The practice wing of Blackwood's music building was quieter than I'd expected. Soundproofed doors lined both sides of the hallway, each with a small window and a room number. Behind some doors, I could hear muffled music—piano, cello, what might have been a clarinet. The hallway itself was austere: polished floors, white walls, fluorescent lighting that cast everything in harsh clarity.

Nothing like the warm chaos of the art studios.

I found 3B halfway down the hall and paused outside the door's small window. Nathan was already inside, sitting in a straight-backed chair, violin case open beside him. He was looking at some papers—sheet music, probably—with that same intense focus I'd observed from across the dining hall.

I took a breath, knocked twice, and opened the door without waiting for an answer.

Nathan looked up. "You're punctual."

"You asked me to be."

"I asked. I didn't expect compliance."

I wasn't sure if that was an insult or a compliment, so I ignored it. The practice room was small—maybe ten feet by twelve—with just a chair, a music stand, and a small upright piano against one wall. The soundproofing made the space feel oddly dead, like sound got absorbed before it could properly resonate.

"This is where you practice?" I tried to keep judgment out of my voice, but the room felt so sterile.

"Every day. Two-hour blocks, sometimes three if I can get the reservation." Nathan gestured to the only chair. "You can sit if you want."

"I'm fine standing." I set my bag down, suddenly very aware of how different we looked. Nathan wore pressed khakis and a button-down shirt, neat and formal. I'd come straight from the studio in paint-stained jeans and a cardigan over a tank top. My hands still had faint color under the fingernails.

"Should we start by discussing the project parameters?" Nathan had a notebook open, pen ready. Of course he did.

"Sure. Professor Reeves wants a collaborative performance piece combining our art forms. Fifteen minutes, performed at the winter showcase, twenty percent of our grade."

"I'm aware of the requirements." Nathan's tone was polite but cool. "I meant we should discuss our approach. What the collaboration actually looks like."

Right. The part where we had to agree on something. "Do you have ideas?"

"I have several. But I'd like to hear yours first."

It felt like a test. I crossed my arms, leaning against the wall. "Okay. I'm thinking live painting. You play violin, I respond with painting in real-time. It would be spontaneous, dynamic, a genuine interaction between music and visual art."

Nathan's expression didn't change, but something flickered in his eyes. "Live painting."

"Yeah. The audience watches both of us create simultaneously. You play, I paint, and the piece emerges organically from that collaboration."

"That sounds..." He paused, clearly choosing words carefully. "Unprofessional."

The word hit like cold water. "Excuse me?"

"How would we ensure quality? How would we know the final product meets performance standards? Live painting means you're creating something unrehearsed in front of an audience. There's no control, no planning, no way to guarantee the result is actually good."

"Art doesn't need to be controlled to be good. Sometimes the best work comes from spontaneity."

"Sometimes the worst work comes from lack of preparation." Nathan set his pen down with precision. "I'm training for conservatory auditions. Every note I play in public reflects on my technical ability and artistic judgment. I can't afford to participate in something that looks amateurish."

"Amateurish?" My voice rose slightly. "Spontaneous doesn't mean amateurish. Some of the most important art movements—abstract expressionism, action painting—were built on spontaneity and emotional immediacy."

"And some of the most important musical traditions—classical performance, orchestral precision—are built on disciplined preparation and planned execution."

We stared at each other. The soundproofed room felt even smaller.

"Fine." I forced myself to stay calm. "What's your idea?"

Nathan flipped to a new page in his notebook. "A carefully choreographed piece. I'd compose an original work or arrange something existing—approximately twelve to fifteen minutes. You'd create visual elements that correspond to specific musical moments. We'd plan each transition, each thematic development, so the music and visuals work together with intentional precision."

"That sounds incredibly boring."

His jaw tightened slightly. "It sounds professional."

"It sounds like you want me to illustrate your music. Like I'm just decorating what you've already created."

"I want us to create something cohesive. That requires structure."

"Structure kills spontaneity. If everything is planned in advance, where's the artistic discovery? Where's the moment of genuine creation?"

"In the planning process. In the thoughtful development of ideas and the skilled execution of a vision." Nathan's voice remained controlled, which somehow made it worse. "We can discover things through careful composition without resorting to improvisation that might fail spectacularly."

"Or improvisation might create something more authentic than anything we could plan."

"Or it might create chaos that reads as undisciplined."

There it was. Undisciplined. The word I'd known was coming since I'd first seen his formal note.

"My work isn't undisciplined. It's intuitive. There's a difference."

"Intuitive without technical foundation is just impulsive." Nathan's tone was still polite, but the words cut. "I've seen your work in the campus gallery. The fall exhibition piece. It was... energetic."

"But?" I could hear the unspoken criticism.

"But it lacked compositional structure. The colors were aggressive, the brushwork chaotic. It felt like you threw paint at a canvas and called it expression."

Heat rose in my face. "That piece took me three weeks. Every color choice, every brushstroke was deliberate. Just because I don't plan every detail in advance doesn't mean there's no intention behind the work."

"Intention isn't the same as technique."

"And technique isn't the same as art." I pushed away from the wall. "You can hit every note perfectly and still create something lifeless. I'd rather make something messy and real than something polished and empty."

"That's a false binary. Technical skill and emotional expression aren't mutually exclusive."

"Then why do you sound like you think structure is the only thing that matters?"

"Why do you sound like you think planning is artistic death?"

We'd raised our voices without meaning to. In the soundproofed room, the argument felt contained, trapped, intense.

I took a breath, trying to reset. This wasn't productive. We needed to find common ground, not drive each other into defensive corners.

"Look," I said, more quietly. "We obviously have different approaches. But we're stuck working together, so we need to find some kind of compromise."

Nathan nodded stiffly. "Agreed."

"What if..." I thought out loud. "What if we try both? We test your structured approach and my spontaneous approach separately, see what works?"

"That could work." He made a note. "We'd need regular meeting times. My schedule is tight, but I can make Tuesday and Thursday evenings work. Nine o'clock, after my practice blocks."

"Fine. But I'm not meeting here." I gestured at the sterile practice room. "My studio. Third floor of the arts building. At least there we'll have space to actually create something."

Nathan looked uncomfortable. "Art studios are... chaotic."

"Art studios are where art happens. You'll survive."

He hesitated, then nodded. "Tuesday and Thursday, nine PM, your studio."

"We'll need to actually decide on an approach eventually. We can't just keep testing ideas for six weeks."

"I'm aware." Nathan closed his notebook. "For our first working session, I'll prepare several short musical pieces. You can try responding to them visually. We'll see if there's potential for collaboration."

It wasn't the passionate creative partnership I'd imagined when Professor Reeves first announced the project, but it was something. A starting point. Better than nothing.

"Okay," I said. "I'll set up some canvases."

"And please don't make assumptions about what I want musically. I'm open to discussion about the direction."

"I'll try not to assume you're a complete control freak."

Nathan's expression flickered—was that almost a smile? "I'll try not to assume you're completely chaotic."

"I am completely chaotic. But it's intentional chaos."

"That's a contradiction."

"Welcome to abstract art."

I picked up my bag, ready to leave. The meeting hadn't gone well, exactly, but we'd survived it. We had a plan for the next session. That counted as progress, sort of.

"Sienna." Nathan's voice stopped me at the door. I turned back.

"This project matters to me," he said. "Not just the grade. I need strong faculty recommendations for conservatory applications. Professor Reeves teaches my advanced theory class. I can't afford to fail this or do mediocre work."

The honesty surprised me. "It matters to me too. I need my GPA for art school applications."

"So we both have stakes beyond just passing."

"Yeah. We do."

Nathan met my eyes directly for the first time since I'd entered the practice room. "Then we'll find a way to make it work. Even if our approaches are incompatible."

"Even if you think I'm undisciplined and I think you're suffocating."

"I didn't say undisciplined was inherently bad."

"You didn't say it was good."

"I said it lacked structure. That's observational, not judgmental."

"It felt judgmental."

"Perhaps you're sensitive about your process."

I laughed, surprised by the directness. "Perhaps you're defensive about yours."

"Perhaps we're both convinced we're right."

"And the other person is wrong."

"Which makes collaboration difficult."

"Impossible, maybe."

Nathan shook his head slightly. "Not impossible. Just challenging. Which is probably the point of the assignment."

He was right, and I hated that he was right. Professor Reeves had deliberately paired opposites to push us outside comfort zones. Challenging our assumptions. Making us grow.

I just wished growth didn't feel quite so uncomfortable.

"See you Tuesday," I said. "Nine o'clock. Don't be late."

"I'm never late."

"Of course you're not."

I left the practice room, walking back through the hallway with its muffled sounds of disciplined practice. By the time I reached the arts building, my frustration had settled into grim determination.

Nathan Brooks was rigid, controlling, and convinced that structure was the only path to good art. But he was also committed to making the project work, which meant I couldn't give up either.

Six weeks. We had six weeks to create something that didn't destroy both our GPAs.

And maybe—though I wasn't holding my breath—we'd figure out how to work together without wanting to throw paint at each other.

Though knowing me, I'd probably throw paint anyway. Just to see his reaction.
