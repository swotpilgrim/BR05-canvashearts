# Chapter 6: Testing the Waters

Nathan arrived at exactly nine o'clock Tuesday evening. I'd been watching the clock, curious whether he'd be early, punctual, or—unlikely—late.

Punctual, of course.

I heard footsteps on the studio stairs, then his knock on the doorframe. I looked up from where I'd been arranging paint supplies.

"Come in."

He stepped into my studio corner, and I watched his expression shift: surprise, dismay, maybe horror. My space probably looked like a disaster to someone used to sterile practice rooms.

Paint-splattered drop cloths covered the floor. Canvases leaned against walls. Mason jars filled with brushes clustered on every surface. The whole space smelled like turpentine, linseed oil, and creative chaos.

"This is..." Nathan paused, searching for diplomatic words. "...your studio."

"Home sweet home. I cleared the central area for our sessions. See? I can be organized."

He looked at the cleared floor space surrounded by controlled chaos. "Very organized."

"I'm choosing to take that as sincere."

Nathan set his violin case down carefully, avoiding a paint-splattered stool. He wore the same kind of clothes as Monday—pressed khakis, button-down shirt—and looked profoundly out of place among the creative disorder.

"I covered my current project," I said, nodding toward a large canvas facing the wall. "Figured it would be distracting."

"I appreciate that."

An awkward silence settled. We were both trying to be professional, but neither of us quite knew how to proceed. The memory of Professor Reeves's lecture hung between us.

"So," I said finally. "Should we start?"

"I prepared three pieces like we discussed." Nathan opened his violin case with practiced care. The instrument inside gleamed under the work lights, wood polished to a warm honey color. "But I was thinking—before we try collaborating, maybe we should each demonstrate our individual process? So we understand what we're working with?"

The suggestion surprised me. "That's actually a good idea."

"Occasionally I have those."

Was that humor? I studied Nathan's expression, but it remained neutral. "Okay. Who goes first?"

"I will, if that's acceptable." He lifted the violin from its case, checking the tuning with small adjustments to the pegs. The movements were automatic, muscle memory from years of practice.

I settled onto a stool, watching. "What are you going to play?"

"Bach. Partita in D Minor, the Allemanda movement. It's technically demanding but structured—a good representation of the precision classical music requires."

"Okay. I'm ready when you are."

Nathan positioned the violin under his chin, bow poised. Then he began to play.

The music was immediate and complex, notes cascading in intricate patterns. His bowing was controlled, each stroke precise. His fingers moved along the fingerboard with practiced accuracy.

Technically, it was flawless. Every note clean, every phrase articulated, every difficult passage executed with confidence.

But something was missing.

I watched Nathan's face as he played. His expression was intensely focused, but not connected. He looked like he was solving a complex math problem, not making music. His eyes stayed open, fixed on some middle distance. His body remained still except for the necessary movements. Nothing swayed with the rhythm, nothing responded to the music's emotional content.

He was performing the notes without inhabiting them.

The piece concluded—I assumed at its natural ending, though I couldn't be sure—and Nathan lowered the violin. "That's Bach. One of the standard solo repertoire pieces."

"It was technically impressive," I said carefully.

"But?" He heard the hesitation.

"Do you always play like you're taking a test?"

Nathan's expression tightened. "I'm executing the composer's intentions with accuracy and respect for the musical line."

"But where's the emotion? Where's your interpretation?"

"The interpretation is in the phrasing, the dynamics, the tempo choices. All of which I executed according to historical performance practice."

"That's not what I meant." I stood, trying to articulate what I'd observed. "You played every note perfectly, but you looked like you were afraid to feel anything while you played. Like emotion would somehow mess up the technique."

"Emotion without technical foundation is sloppy."

"Technique without emotion is empty."

"That's a false dichotomy."

"Is it? Because from where I was sitting, I just heard someone play music without actually connecting to it."

Nathan's jaw tightened. "I connected to it through skilled execution. Not everything requires dramatic emotional display."

"I'm not asking for drama. I'm asking for... presence. Like you actually care about the music beyond hitting the right notes."

"I do care." His voice was controlled, but I could hear frustration beneath it. "Just because I don't perform emotion doesn't mean I don't feel it."

"Then why hide it?"

"I'm not hiding anything. I'm maintaining professional standards." Nathan set his violin back in its case with careful precision. "Your turn. Show me your process."

The challenge was clear. I'd criticized his approach; now he'd watch mine and return the favor.

Fine.

I grabbed a fresh canvas—one of three I'd prepared—and positioned it on an easel in the cleared space. My paint supplies were already arranged on a rolling cart: acrylics in primary colors plus black and white, various brushes, palette knives, a spray bottle of water.

"What are you painting?" Nathan asked.

"I don't know yet."

"How can you not know?"

"That's the point. I don't plan. I respond to instinct and feeling." I selected a large brush and loaded it with cadmium red straight from the tube. "Watch."

I didn't give myself time to think. I hit the canvas with bold strokes, dragging the brush across the surface. Red slashed across white, aggressive and immediate.

The music from my speaker—indie rock I'd cued up earlier—pounded through the studio. I let it guide my movements. More red. Then orange mixing into the red, colors colliding.

My arm moved in wide arcs. Paint splattered. The brush danced across canvas, following rhythms I felt rather than planned. Black for contrast, white knifed through to create tension.

I was dimly aware of Nathan watching, but I didn't slow down. This was my process—pure, spontaneous, emotional.

Ten minutes later, I stepped back, breathing hard. The canvas was covered in aggressive reds and oranges with slashes of black and white. It vibrated with energy.

"That's how I work," I said, setting the brush down.

Nathan was staring at the painting, expression unreadable. "That took ten minutes."

"Yes."

"You didn't plan any of it."

"No."

"You just... attacked the canvas."

"I responded to impulse and feeling. It's called gestural abstraction. Action painting."

"It's chaos."

"It's expression." I crossed my arms, defensive despite trying not to be. "Not everything needs to be planned in advance. Sometimes the best art comes from letting go of control."

"And sometimes letting go of control just creates mess." Nathan gestured at the painting. "How do you know that's good? How do you know it communicates anything beyond random color application?"

"I know because I feel it. The energy is right, the composition works, the emotional content is present."

"Composition? Where's the composition? It's just paint thrown at canvas."

Heat rose in my face. "It's not thrown. Every stroke is deliberate, even if it's not planned. There's intention behind the chaos."

"Intention isn't the same as technique. You said that to me earlier. It applies to you too."

We were arguing again. Despite Professor Reeves's lecture, despite our fresh start agreement, we'd immediately reverted to attacking each other's methods.

I took a breath. "Okay. Let's reset. We agreed to try collaborating, not to criticize each other's individual processes."

Nathan nodded stiffly. "You're right. I apologize."

"I apologize too. I shouldn't have criticized your playing."

"And your painting has energy, even if I don't understand your process."

We looked at each other, both frustrated, both trying.

"This is harder than I expected," I admitted.

"Significantly harder."

"Professor Reeves said we need each other. That you could benefit from spontaneity and I could benefit from structure."

"She's probably right." Nathan glanced at his watch. "We have an hour left in our scheduled session. Should we try the original plan? I play three pieces, you attempt to paint responsively?"

"We can try. At least we'll see if there's potential for our art forms to interact."

"Low expectations seem prudent."

That almost made me smile. "Very prudent."

Nathan returned to his violin case, pulling out sheet music. "I prepared three pieces. Fast Bach, slow Brahms, and Mozart. Different tempos and moods."

"I'll use separate canvases for each."

"That works."

I positioned the three canvases, arranging them for easy access. Paint supplies ready. Nathan raised his violin. "Ready?"

"Ready."

The Bach invention was fast, intricate. I loaded my brush and tried to respond, painting in quick strokes that matched the tempo.

But it felt disconnected. No genuine interaction between art forms.

When Nathan finished, we looked at the canvas. Quick, nervous brushstrokes that captured tempo but nothing else.

"That didn't work," I said.

"Agreed. Next piece?"

The slow Brahms was better. The measured pace gave me time to think. But it felt constrained, like I was illustrating rather than responding.

"Still not right," Nathan said.

"No. But closer."

"Third piece?"

He played the Mozart sonata, and something shifted. The music had playful energy, moments of lightness mixed with more serious themes. I found myself listening for a few measures before painting, trying to feel the music's character instead of just reacting to tempo.

My brushwork loosened. Colors began to dance instead of just fill space. The painting captured something beyond simple response—it started to feel like conversation.

When Nathan lowered his violin, we both looked at the third canvas in silence.

"That one worked better," he said finally.

"It did. Why?"

"You listened first. You waited to understand the music before responding to it."

"And you played with more expression. That last piece had more life than the Bach."

"Mozart is harder to play mechanically. The phrasing demands more interpretation."

We stood there, looking at three canvases in varying degrees of success. The first was a failure, the second mediocre, the third showed actual potential.

"We should keep trying," I said. "Use Thursday's session to develop the approach that worked with the Mozart."

"Agreed." Nathan checked his watch. "It's ten-thirty. I should let you go."

"Okay. Thursday, same time?"

"I'll be here."

He packed his violin with the same careful attention he'd unpacked it, every movement precise. I walked him to the studio stairs.

"Thank you for trying," Nathan said at the doorway. "I know my process frustrates you."

"Thank you for being patient with mine. I know my chaos makes you uncomfortable."

"Perhaps we'll both become more comfortable with discomfort."

"That's the hope."

After he left, I looked at the three canvases. Evidence of our first real collaboration attempt. Mostly failure, but with one glimpse of possibility.

It wasn't much. But it was something.

A starting point.
