# Chapter 8: Crossing Territories

On Wednesday afternoon, I found myself standing outside Practice Room 3B with a notebook and growing uncertainty about whether this had been a good idea.

After Thursday's successful collaboration, I'd been thinking about what made the Mozart piece work. Nathan's playing had been more expressive, more alive. But his default mode was still that controlled, emotionless precision I'd seen in our first session.

I wanted to understand why. Which meant I needed to see his normal practice process, not just the collaborative work he brought to our sessions.

So I'd left him a note Tuesday night, asking if I could observe one of his regular practice sessions. No collaboration, no pressure to perform for me. Just watching him work.

He'd responded with characteristic formality: *Wednesday 2pm, Practice Room 3B. You may observe, but please don't interrupt during practice blocks.*

Now, standing in the music wing hallway, I wondered if I was overstepping. Nathan's practice time was clearly sacred to him. Letting me into that space felt like an invasion of privacy, even if he'd agreed.

But I'd asked, and he'd said yes. So I knocked twice and opened the door.

Nathan looked up from his music stand, violin already in hand. "You came."

"You said I could."

"I did. I just wasn't sure you'd actually follow through." He gestured to the only other piece of furniture—a small bench against the wall. "Sit there. Try not to make noise during active practice time."

"I'll be quiet."

I settled on the bench, pulling out my notebook. Nathan watched me for a moment, expression unreadable, then turned back to his music stand.

"I have this room reserved until four," he said. "Two hours. I'll be working on Sibelius—the concerto I'm preparing for auditions. It's technical work, mostly repetitive drilling. Not particularly interesting to watch."

"That's okay. I want to see your actual process."

He nodded, raised his violin, and began.

For the first ten minutes, I tried to make sense of what I was watching. Nathan would play a few measures, stop, make a note, then play the same measures again. Sometimes the repetition sounded identical. Sometimes I could hear minute differences.

He worked with intense focus, completely absorbed in microscopic details. His expression never changed. His body stayed rigid except for necessary movements. Nothing suggested he was enjoying himself.

After twenty minutes, he'd worked through maybe thirty seconds of music. The same thirty seconds, over and over, each repetition slightly different.

It was mesmerizing and disturbing in equal measure.

I'd never worked on anything with this level of detailed precision. My painting process was about big gestures, emotional energy, spontaneous response. Nathan's practice was about perfecting tiny elements until they met some internal standard of acceptability.

At the half-hour mark, he finally moved to a new section of music. Same process: play a few measures, stop, adjust, repeat. His movements were economical and controlled. Nothing wasted, nothing spontaneous.

I made notes in my notebook, trying to capture what I was observing. Not the technical details—I didn't understand music theory well enough for that—but the emotional quality. Or lack thereof.

*He plays like he's solving equations,* I wrote. *Technically precise but emotionally absent. Where's the joy? Where's the passion that made him start playing music in the first place?*

An hour into the session, Nathan took a short break. He lowered his violin, rolled his shoulders, drank water from a bottle in his case. His practice journal lay open beside the music stand, filled with detailed notes in his neat handwriting.

"You're still here," he said, noticing me on the bench.

"You said I could stay for the full session."

"I did. I'm just surprised you're not bored."

"I'm not bored. I'm..." I paused, searching for the right word. "Fascinated. You work so differently than I do."

"Disciplined practice requires repetition and attention to detail."

"I can see that. But doesn't it get exhausting? Working on the same few measures for an hour?"

"Exhausting is knowing a passage isn't perfect and leaving it unfinished." He tightened his bow slightly, checking the tension. "If I can't execute this cleanly now, I won't be able to execute it under audition pressure. Better to drill it correctly a hundred times than to hope improvisation will carry me through."

There was that word again. Improvisation, said like it was dangerous.

Nathan resumed playing, and I resumed watching. The second hour looked identical to the first—meticulous repetition, technical adjustment, relentless focus on detail. He made steady progress through the piece, but the atmosphere never changed. Same intensity, same joyless discipline.

By four o'clock, when his reservation ended, I was both impressed and deeply bothered.

Nathan packed his violin with the same careful attention he brought to everything. "So. What did you think?"

"You're incredibly disciplined."

"But?" He heard the unspoken criticism.

I closed my notebook, trying to find words that wouldn't sound insulting. "When's the last time you played something just for fun?"

Nathan's expression shifted to confusion. "Fun?"

"Yeah. Music you love, not because it's technically challenging or good for auditions, but because it makes you happy."

"Music isn't about happiness. It's about skill, interpretation, artistic excellence."

"But why did you start playing? There must have been something about music that drew you in before it became all about conservatory auditions and technical perfection."

He was quiet for a moment, violin case half-closed. "I was five. My parents took me to hear the Boston Symphony. I heard the violin solo in Scheherazade and told my mother I wanted to make that sound."

"The sound. Not perfect technique or flawless execution. The sound that moved you."

"That was thirteen years ago."

"When's the last time you played something that moved you the way that solo did?"

Nathan's jaw tightened. "I play challenging repertoire every day. Music that represents the pinnacle of compositional and technical achievement."

"That's not what I asked."

"Then I don't understand the question."

I stood, frustrated but also sympathetic. "I'm asking when you last played something because you wanted to, not because you had to. When you last let yourself enjoy music instead of treating it like work you're being graded on."

"Music is work I'm being graded on. That's literally what conservatory auditions are."

"But is that all it is?" I moved closer, needing him to hear this. "Nathan, I watched you practice for two hours. You were technically brilliant. Every note perfect, every phrase shaped correctly. But you looked miserable. Like you were punishing yourself, not creating art."

"I was correcting technical issues."

"You were drilling yourself like a machine." My voice rose slightly. "Where's the passion? Where's the reason you fell in love with music in the first place?"

"Passion doesn't matter if the technique isn't there."

"Technique doesn't matter if there's nothing behind it!" I took a breath, forcing myself to calm down. "I'm not saying discipline is bad. You've taught me that structure has value. But structure without joy is just a prison."

Nathan set his violin case down, turning to face me fully. "You don't understand the pressure. If I don't get into a top conservatory, thirteen years of training and my parents' investment and all my teachers' time will have been wasted. I can't afford to play for fun. I have to play for results."

"But art without joy loses its soul." I said it quietly this time. "You said my work needed more structure. You're right. But your work needs more heart. More willingness to take risks and feel things instead of just executing perfectly."

"Risks lead to mistakes."

"Mistakes are part of being human. Part of being an artist."

"Not in my world. In my world, one wrong note can destroy an audition."

"Then your world sounds terrifying."

The words hung between us. Nathan looked stricken, like I'd articulated something he'd been trying not to acknowledge.

"I'm sorry," I said. "That was harsh."

"But accurate." He ran a hand through his hair, a rare gesture of frustration. "I don't know how to play without the fear. It's been so long since music felt like anything other than a test I'm trying to pass."

My heart ached for him. "Thursday night, when you played the Mozart—you loosened up a little. Let yourself interpret instead of just execute. You looked different. More alive."

"I felt different. Terrified, but also... free. For those few minutes."

"What if you let yourself feel that more often?"

"What if I make mistakes?"

"Then you make mistakes. You learn from them. You grow." I picked up my notebook. "That's what collaboration is teaching me. That failing at something isn't the end of the world. It's part of the process."

Nathan was quiet, absorbing this. The practice room felt smaller suddenly, more intimate.

"Our Tuesday session," he said. "I was thinking we'd work on longer pieces. Build on what succeeded with the Mozart."

"Okay. But can I make a suggestion?"

"Please."

"When you play Tuesday, don't just think about technical execution. Think about what you're communicating. What you want me to feel when I hear the music."

"That's not how I usually approach pieces."

"I know. But maybe it should be." I headed toward the door, then paused. "Thank you for letting me watch today. I know that was probably uncomfortable."

"It was." Nathan picked up his violin case. "But you're right that I needed to hear it. What you said about joy and soul."

"And you were right that I needed to hear about structure and discipline. We're both learning."

"Slowly."

"Very slowly."

He walked with me out of the practice wing, into the late afternoon autumn air. Students crisscrossed the campus, heading to dinner or evening activities.

"I'll see you Tuesday," Nathan said at the pathway split. "Nine o'clock."

"I'll be there."

I watched him walk toward his dorm, violin case in hand, posture straight as always. But something about him seemed less rigid than before. Like our conversation had cracked something open, just slightly.

Back in the studio, I thought about what I'd witnessed. Two hours of brilliant, joyless practice. Technical perfection pursued at the expense of emotional connection.

It made sense now, why our collaboration had been so difficult initially. Nathan had spent years learning to suppress feeling in favor of control. And I'd spent years learning to trust feeling over structure.

We were each missing what the other had in excess.

Professor Reeves had known exactly what she was doing when she paired us.

I pulled out my sketchbook and started making notes for Tuesday's session. Ways to help Nathan connect to emotion while maintaining his technical skill. Ways to accept his need for structure while preserving my spontaneous process.

This collaboration was changing both of us.

And maybe that was the entire point.
