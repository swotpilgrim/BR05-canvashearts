# Chapter 11: Finding the Rhythm

"You're doing it again," Madison said from across our dorm room.

I looked up from my sketchbook. "Doing what?"

"Staring into space with that smile. Thinking about your collaboration with Nathan?"

"I'm planning color palettes for Thursday's session."

"Sure. The color palette. Not the violinist."

I threw my pencil at her, but she was kind of right. It was Thursday afternoon, and Nathan and I had found a rhythm—meeting twice a week, creating pieces that actually worked, our sessions running later as we became more absorbed in the process.

"He's bringing new compositions tonight," I said. "Original pieces he's been working on."

"He's composing original music now?"

"Improvising with me made him want to try creating his own work." I sketched out a color blocking idea. "It's a big deal for him."

"You're really proud of him."

"I am. He's grown so much. You should have seen him in the beginning—so rigid, so afraid of mistakes. Now he improvises for twenty minutes straight."

Madison gave me a knowing look. "And you've grown too. Your studio looks organized, you plan compositions, you think about structure."

"He's teaching me a lot."

"And you light up when you talk about him."

I set my sketchbook down. "Can we not do this?"

"Do what?"

"Imply there's something romantic happening. We're collaboration partners becoming friends. That's all."

"Friends who spend hours a week creating art together and texting between sessions."

"That's called collaboration."

Before I could argue further, my stomach growled. Madison grinned.

"Dinner?" she suggested. "You need to eat before your definitely-just-friendly session tonight."

We headed to Willoughby Hall's dining room, which was already crowded with students. Madison and I got in line, loading our trays with the evening's offerings.

"How's your photography project?" I asked, changing the subject.

"Really well! We're presenting next week. You and Nathan should come."

"I'll ask if he's free."

"'I'll ask if he's free,'" Madison mimicked. "So casual."

I ignored her, scanning for empty seats. Most of the visual arts crowd was at our usual table.

"Sienna!" One of my painting seminar classmates, James, waved us over. "Haven't seen you much lately. You're always disappearing to the studio."

"Collaboration project," I explained, sitting down. "Takes a lot of evening time."

"How's that going?" Another painter, Keisha, asked. "You got paired with a music student, right?"

"Nathan Brooks. Violin. It's actually going really well."

"Lucky you." Keisha made a face. "My partner wants to do everything her way. No compromise, no collaboration, just her vision with my art as decoration."

"That sounds frustrating."

"It's a nightmare. I might ask Professor Reeves to reassign us."

Across the hall, I spotted Nathan at the music students' usual table. He was talking with Ethan, looking more relaxed than I'd seen him in the dining hall before. Not so isolated, more engaged with the conversation.

He glanced up, caught my eye, and smiled. A real smile, not the barely-there flicker from the beginning of the semester.

I smiled back, then returned my attention to my table before Madison could make commentary.

"So your partner's actually cooperative?" James asked.

"Very. We had a rocky start, but once we figured out how to communicate, it clicked. Now we're creating pieces that neither of us could make alone."

"Must be nice." Keisha sighed. "My partner thinks I should just copy whatever she choreographs. Zero creative input."

As we ate, I half-listened to the conversation around me while my mind wandered to tonight's session. Nathan had mentioned trying a longer piece, something substantial enough to potentially use for the showcase. The idea excited me—a large canvas, extended improvisation, real depth of collaboration.

I was so absorbed in planning that I didn't notice Vanessa Price approaching our table until she was standing right behind my chair.

"Sienna," she said, her voice carrying that particular tone she used when about to say something critical. "I've been hearing about your little music project."

I turned to face her. Vanessa was a senior like me, specializing in hyperrealistic portraiture. Technically skilled, academically competitive, and convinced her approach to art was superior to anyone else's.

"My collaboration with Nathan? It's going well, thanks."

"Is it?" Vanessa's smile didn't reach her eyes. "Because I saw some photos you posted in the studio group chat. Very... energetic."

"Abstract expressionism. It's my style."

"Style is one word for it." Vanessa pulled out her phone, scrolling. "But I'm curious—is it actually art when you're just throwing paint at a canvas while someone plays violin? Or is it more like... performance entertainment?"

Heat rose in my face. "It's collaborative art. Combining visual and musical mediums."

"But where's the technical skill? Where's the planning, the composition, the intentional craft?" Vanessa showed her phone to the table—one of my collaboration pieces from last week. "This looks like what happens when you let a process overtake actual artistry. It's chaotic."

"It's responsive," I said, keeping my voice level. "The composition emerges from the dialogue between music and painting. That requires a different kind of skill than realistic portraiture."

"Does it? Or are you just making excuses for sloppy work?" Vanessa pocketed her phone. "I'm not trying to be mean. I'm genuinely asking. Because from an outside perspective, it looks like you're spending more time with your boyfriend than actually creating serious art."

"He's not my boyfriend. He's my collaboration partner."

"Whatever you want to call him." Vanessa shrugged. "I just think it's interesting that you used to create thoughtful portfolio pieces, and now you're making messy paintings while a musician plays in the background. Seems like a step backward."

She walked away before I could respond, leaving uncomfortable silence at our table.

"She's wrong," Madison said immediately. "Your collaboration pieces are incredible."

"They're different," Keisha added. "But different isn't bad. Vanessa just can't appreciate anything that isn't photorealistic."

I pushed food around my plate, appetite gone. "What if she's right, though? What if I'm letting the collaboration become more important than the actual art?"

"Are you kidding?" James pulled out his own phone, scrolling to the studio group chat. "This piece from Tuesday—it's sophisticated. The colors work together, the composition has rhythm and structure. It's not chaos. It's controlled energy."

"Vanessa's jealous," Madison said firmly. "Her project is struggling, yours is succeeding, and she can't handle it."

Maybe they were right. But Vanessa's words had planted doubt. Was I compromising my artistic integrity for the sake of collaboration? Was I so focused on making things work with Nathan that I'd stopped pushing myself creatively?

The rest of dinner passed in a blur. I went through the motions of conversation, but my mind was churning with uncertainty.

Back in our room, I studied photos of my recent collaboration pieces, trying to see what Vanessa saw.

They were different from my usual work. More structured. Less purely spontaneous.

But were they worse? Or just different?

Madison appeared behind me. "Stop letting Vanessa get in your head. Your work is good. You're growing as an artist."

"Or I'm diluting my style."

"You're collaborating. That's the assignment. And you're thriving. I've never seen you so excited about creating."

My phone buzzed. Text from Nathan: *Looking forward to tonight. Brought three new compositions. I think you'll like them.*

I smiled despite my lingering doubts. *Can't wait to try them.*

*Are you okay? You seemed distracted at dinner.*

The fact that he'd noticed from across the dining hall made that warm feeling bloom in my chest again. *I'm fine. See you at nine.*

Madison read over my shoulder. "He noticed you were upset from across a crowded dining hall. And he cares enough to check in."

"So?"

"So that's not nothing." She stood. "Go to your session. Create something beautiful with Nathan. Prove to yourself that Vanessa's wrong."

She was right. The best response to criticism was to create work that spoke for itself.

At eight-thirty, I headed to the studio to prepare. Large canvas—six feet by four feet—already primed and positioned. Paint supplies organized with more care than I would have bothered with a month ago. Space cleared for Nathan's performance area.

He arrived at exactly nine, carrying his violin case and a folder of sheet music.

"Hey," he said, smiling. Then his expression shifted to concern. "What's wrong?"

"How do you know something's wrong?"

"You have this line between your eyebrows when you're upset." He set his violin case down. "What happened?"

I told him about Vanessa's comments at dinner. About her questions whether our collaboration was real art or just performance entertainment. About my uncertainty whether I was growing or compromising.

Nathan listened without interrupting. When I finished, he was quiet for a moment.

"Can I show you something?" he asked.

He pulled out his phone, opened his photos. "These are my practice journal entries from September. Before we started working together."

I looked at the images. Pages filled with technical notes, criticism of his own performance, pressure and anxiety written in neat handwriting.

"Now look at this week's entries."

The recent pages were completely different. Still organized, still detailed, but filled with observations about musical expression, emotional interpretation, joy in the creative process.

"You changed this for me," Nathan said quietly. "Taught me that music could be about more than perfection. That risk and spontaneity have value. That sometimes the best art comes from letting go."

"But what if Vanessa's right? What if I'm losing what makes my work mine?"

"You're not losing it. You're expanding it." Nathan gestured at my organized studio space. "You still paint with passion and intuition. But now you also think about composition and structure. You're becoming more complete as an artist, not less."

"How do you know?"

"Because I see it. Every session, your work gets stronger. More sophisticated. The spontaneity is still there, but it's enhanced by intention." He met my eyes directly. "And our collaboration isn't diminishing either of our individual work. It's making us both better at what we do."

The certainty in his voice steadied me. "You really believe that?"

"Absolutely. And I'm grateful every day that Professor Reeves paired us together."

Something in the way he said it—grateful, looking at me like that—made my breath catch.

"So," Nathan continued, "should we create something that proves Vanessa Price completely wrong about collaborative art?"

I smiled. "Yes. Let's do that."

He unpacked his violin with familiar movements while I positioned myself in front of the large canvas. Ready to create, doubt pushed aside by determination.

"Ready?" Nathan asked, bow poised.

"Ready."

And we began.
