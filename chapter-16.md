# Chapter 16: When Artists Connect

Saturday afternoon light slanted across my phone screen when Nathan's text arrived: *Want to take a walk? Need to clear my head before we work tonight.*

I stared at the message for a full minute. In the six weeks we'd been collaborating, we'd never met outside our scheduled Tuesday and Thursday sessions. Our relationship existed in the contained universe of the studio after dark—paint fumes and violin rosin, the intimacy of creation. A Saturday afternoon walk felt different. Deliberate.

*Sure*, I typed back. *Quad in ten minutes?*

I found him waiting on the stone steps outside Willoughby Hall, hands shoved in the pockets of a charcoal peacoat I'd never seen him wear. Without his violin case, he looked somehow unmoored, like seeing a teacher outside school. The November wind scattered leaves across the quad, and I pulled my cardigan tighter.

"Hey," he said, and we fell into step without discussing direction.

The campus looked different in daylight, softer. We walked past the arts building where our studio waited empty, past the music wing where Nathan spent his structured practice hours. The oak trees lining the quad had turned brilliant orange and gold, and the late afternoon sun made everything look painted.

"I've been thinking about what Professor Reeves said," Nathan began. "About tension creating interesting art."

"When she told us to figure it out or fail?" I smiled slightly. "That was very inspiring."

"No, after that. When she said sometimes the best work comes from being challenged." He glanced at me. "I think she might be right."

We reached the stone benches at the quad's center, and without discussing it, we sat. The bench was cold through my jeans, but neither of us moved to leave.

"Can I ask you something?" Nathan turned toward me, his expression more open than I'd seen it. "Why art? Your parents must have asked you to consider something more... practical."

I laughed, the sound slightly bitter. "You mean something that would actually pay bills? Yeah, they've mentioned it. About a thousand times."

"What do they want you to do?"

"My mom's a nurse. She keeps suggesting healthcare administration. 'You're creative, Sienna, you could design hospital marketing materials.'" I mimicked her hopeful tone. "My dad's an accountant. He just looks worried whenever I mention art school."

"But they support you being here?"

"They love me," I said carefully. "They paid for my application to Blackwood, they drove six hours to drop me off junior year, they ask about my classes. But I don't think they understand why I'd choose a path with no guarantees. To them, art is a hobby, not a career."

Nathan was quiet for a moment, watching the wind move through the oak branches. "My family's the opposite problem."

"What do you mean?"

"Five generations of musicians." He said it like a sentence, not a legacy. "My great-great-grandfather played first violin for the Boston Symphony. My grandmother taught at Juilliard. My mother's a concert pianist. My father's a conductor."

"That sounds amazing."

"It sounds like expectation." The words came out sharper than I think he intended. He softened. "It's not that they're cruel about it. They just... assume. Of course I'll get into a top conservatory. Of course I'll pursue performance. Of course music is my life. They've never asked if it's what I want."

"Is it?" I asked quietly. "What you want?"

He was silent so long I thought he wouldn't answer. "I don't know anymore. I used to love it—playing, I mean. When I was eight, nine years old, I'd practice for hours because I wanted to, not because anyone made me. But somewhere along the way it became about being perfect. Meeting standards. Earning approval." He met my eyes. "Before this collaboration, I hadn't enjoyed playing in years."

Something in my chest tightened. "Before?"

"You changed that." He said it simply, like fact. "Watching you paint—you're so free. You trust yourself. I forgot what that felt like."

I wanted to tell him I wasn't free at all, that half the time I was terrified my spontaneity was just chaos, that watching his discipline had made me question everything I thought I knew about art. But the words stuck.

"So we're both trying to prove something," I said instead. "Me to parents who don't think art is real work, you to a family who assumes you'll be brilliant at it."

"Apparently." A smile ghosted across his face. "We're a mess."

"A highly functional mess," I corrected. "Our collaboration piece doesn't look like the product of two people having existential crises."

"That's because you made me stop having existential crises long enough to actually create something."

The conversation was getting too serious, too revealing. I shifted topics. "Okay, lighter question. Who's your favorite composer?"

"Besides Bach?" He pretended to think. "Brahms. His violin sonatas are... I don't know how to describe it. Melancholy and hopeful at the same time."

"I get that. My favorite painter is Rothko. His color field paintings feel like emotion you can stand inside."

"The big color blocks?" Nathan looked genuinely interested. "I always thought those were just... blocks."

"That's what everyone thinks until they stand in front of one. The colors aren't flat—they pulse. They have depth. You feel it in your chest." I was gesturing now, excited. "It's like how your violin playing isn't just notes. It's the space between the notes, the way you shape sound."

"I never thought about it that way." He smiled, and it transformed his whole face. "You should teach art history."

"Only if you teach music appreciation. 'Understanding Why Classical Music Isn't Boring, with Professor Brooks.'"

He laughed—actually laughed, head tilted back. I'd made him smile before, but this was different. Open and genuine and completely unguarded.

"What?" he asked, catching me watching.

"Nothing. I just... I don't think I've heard you laugh like that before."

"I don't laugh much." He said it without self-pity, just observation.

"You should. It's a good laugh."

The air between us shifted, became charged. We were sitting close enough that I could see the exact green of his eyes, close enough to notice the way his hair fell across his forehead. The quad had emptied—just us and the November wind and the weight of everything unspoken.

"Sienna," he started, then stopped.

My heart was beating too fast. "Yeah?"

But whatever he'd been about to say, he changed his mind. "We should probably head to the studio soon. If we're working tonight."

Disappointment and relief flooded through me in equal measure. "Right. Yeah."

We stood, the moment breaking like glass. The walk back across campus felt different than the walk out—we were more careful now, maintaining space between us. Not quite touching.

"Thank you," Nathan said when we reached the arts building. "For the walk. For talking."

"Anytime." I meant it.

"I'll see you at nine?"

"I'll be there."

I watched him walk toward the music wing before heading up to the studio. Madison was in our dorm room when I stopped by to grab my painting jacket, and she took one look at my face and grinned.

"You went on a date."

"It wasn't a date. It was a walk."

"A walk where you talked about your feelings and stared into each other's eyes?"

"We were having a conversation about family pressure and artistic influence," I said with as much dignity as I could manage.

"Sure. And how did this totally platonic, definitely-not-a-date conversation end?"

I thought about that charged moment on the bench, the way Nathan had almost said something, the careful distance we'd maintained walking back. "It didn't."

Madison's expression softened. "Oh, honey. You're falling for him."

"I'm collaborating with him."

"You can do both."

"It's complicated."

"The best things usually are." She flopped onto her bed. "For what it's worth, I think he's falling for you too."

"You don't know that."

"I've seen the way he looks at you in the dining hall. Like you're the only person in the room." She grinned. "Also, Ethan told me Nathan talks about you constantly. 'Sienna thinks this, Sienna said that, Sienna's approach to composition'—apparently you're his new favorite subject."

I tried not to let that information make me ridiculously happy. Failed completely.

When I arrived at the studio at nine, Nathan was already there, tuning his violin. He looked up when I entered, and something in his expression had changed since this afternoon. More settled. More certain.

"Ready to work?" he asked.

"Always."

But as we set up our space, as Nathan began to play and I prepared my canvas, the air felt different than our previous sessions. Charged with awareness. Every time our hands accidentally brushed passing supplies, every time I caught him watching me paint, every time he smiled at something I said—it all meant more now.

We'd crossed some invisible line this afternoon on those stone benches. We'd stopped being just collaborators and become something else. Something I couldn't quite name and wasn't ready to acknowledge.

But as I painted and Nathan played, as our improvisation wove together with the easy synchronization we'd developed, I couldn't deny it anymore.

I was falling for Nathan Brooks.

And terrifying as that was, I didn't want to stop.
