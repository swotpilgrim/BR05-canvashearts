# Chapter 19: Public and Private

By the third week of November, Nathan and I had become campus gossip.

I first noticed it in the dining hall Monday evening. I walked in with Madison to find Vanessa Price and her hyperrealist painting crew watching us from their usual table. When I met Vanessa's eyes, she whispered something to the girl beside her, and they both smirked.

"Ignore them," Madison muttered, steering me toward the food line.

But as we moved through the dining hall, I felt eyes following me. Not hostile, exactly. Just... curious. Aware.

"Is it just me, or is everyone staring?" I asked quietly.

"They're not staring at you." Madison grabbed a tray. "They're staring at you and Nathan. Your little collaboration project has become the talk of Blackwood."

"What? Why?"

She gave me a look. "Because every other interdisciplinary team is struggling to figure out how to make their art forms work together, and you two are apparently creating masterpieces twice a week. Professor Reeves used you as an example in her class Friday. 'This is what genuine collaboration looks like,' or something like that."

I felt heat creep up my neck. "She did?"

"Also, you're spending every Tuesday and Thursday night alone in the studio until midnight with the hot, mysterious violin guy. People notice these things." Madison selected a sandwich. "Half the school thinks you're dating already."

"We're not dating. We're working on a project."

"Sure. A project that requires you to gaze into each other's eyes while creating emotionally resonant art." She grinned. "Very professional."

I was saved from responding by Julian Foster appearing beside us in line.

"Sienna! I've been meaning to ask—" Julian was a composition major, friendly with everyone, one of those people who bridged social groups effortlessly. "Would you and Nathan mind if I observed one of your sessions? I'm working on my own interdisciplinary piece, and Professor Reeves said your collaboration is the model to study."

"Oh. Um." I wasn't sure how I felt about an audience. Our studio sessions had become intensely private. "I'd have to ask Nathan."

"Of course, of course. No pressure. I'm just curious about your process." Julian smiled. "The music department is buzzing about Nathan, by the way. Apparently he's playing with completely different energy than usual. Ethan said it's like working with a different person."

After Julian left, Madison raised her eyebrows meaningfully. "See? Campus news."

We found seats at our usual table. Nathan was already there with Ethan and two other music students, eating while reviewing sheet music. He looked up as we approached, and his entire expression shifted when he saw me. Softer. Open.

My stomach did that stupid flipping thing it had been doing increasingly often.

"Hey," he said.

"Hey yourself." I slid into the seat across from him, hyper-aware that people were watching. "Julian just asked if he could observe one of our sessions."

"Really? What did you tell him?"

"That I'd ask you. Are you okay with it?"

Nathan considered. "Maybe toward the end of the project. Right now I'm still figuring things out. An audience feels like too much pressure."

"Agreed."

Ethan looked between us, amused. "You two have your own language now. It's weird."

"We've been working together for two months," I said defensively. "Of course we have shorthand."

"It's cute," one of the other music students—a flutist named Amy—offered. "You finish each other's sentences in Professor Reeves's class."

"We do not—"

"You absolutely do," Madison confirmed. "Last week she asked about interdisciplinary challenges and Nathan started answering, then you picked up mid-thought, then he finished. It was like watching tennis."

Nathan and I looked at each other. Had we really become that synchronized?

Vanessa's voice cut across the dining hall, deliberately loud. "Some people are spending so much time with their collaboration partners, you'd think they're dating instead of actually working."

The comment was clearly directed at our table. Several people glanced over. I felt my face flame.

Madison turned in her seat. "Some people are just jealous their projects aren't going as well."

"I'm not jealous of slapping paint on canvas while someone plays elevator music," Vanessa shot back. "That's not serious art. It's performance."

"Performance art is a legitimate medium," Nathan said quietly, but with steel underneath. I'd never heard him defend our work before.

Vanessa stood, gathering her tray. "Whatever you say. I'm sure the showcase judges will be very impressed by your little paint-and-music show." She swept out, leaving tension in her wake.

"She's awful," Amy said flatly.

"She's threatened," Ethan corrected. "Her hyperrealism project is apparently not going well. Her partner quit last week."

I felt a small, unworthy surge of satisfaction.

The rest of dinner passed in normal conversation, but I couldn't shake the awareness of being watched. Of people making assumptions. Of the careful distance Nathan and I maintained even as everyone else seemed to see something we weren't acknowledging.

Later that week, Madison cornered me in our dorm room while I was getting ready for Thursday's session.

"Okay, we need to talk." She sat on my bed, blocking my path to the door.

"I'm going to be late—"

"For your definitely-not-a-date with Nathan?" She crossed her arms. "Sienna. Come on. You're falling for him."

"I'm collaborating with him."

"You're doing both. And it's painfully obvious to everyone except apparently the two of you."

I sat down heavily on my desk chair. "What if I am falling for him? What am I supposed to do about it?"

"Tell him?"

"And risk destroying the best creative partnership I've ever had? Ruin the project we've been working on for two months? Make the next four weeks until the showcase incredibly awkward?" I shook my head. "No. Absolutely not."

"What if he feels the same way?"

"What if he doesn't?" The fear tasted bitter. "What if I tell him and he's horrified, and suddenly we can't work together anymore, and we fail the project, and I've ruined everything?"

Madison's expression softened. "Honey. I've seen you two together. I've watched him look at you. Trust me—he's not going to be horrified."

"You don't know that."

"I know he rescheduled his regular practice times so he could meet you Tuesday and Thursday nights. I know Ethan says Nathan talks about you constantly. I know you light up when you see him in the dining hall." She reached over and squeezed my hand. "I also know you're terrified, and that's okay. But eventually you're going to have to decide if the risk is worth it."

I didn't have an answer for that.

When I arrived at the studio at nine, Nathan was already setting up. We'd fallen into an easy routine over the weeks—he'd arrive first and tune his violin while I mixed paints and prepared canvases. Comfortable. Familiar.

Except tonight, I couldn't stop thinking about Madison's words. About everyone on campus seeing something between us. About the question of whether Nathan felt what I felt.

"You okay?" Nathan asked, setting down his bow. "You seem distracted."

"Just thinking." I tied on my painting jacket. "Julian really wants to observe a session."

"We could let him come next week. If you're comfortable with it."

"Maybe." I squeezed burnt umber onto my palette. "Does it bother you? That people are talking about our project?"

Nathan was quiet for a moment. "What are they saying?"

"That we're the example to follow. That our collaboration is working better than anyone else's." I paused. "That we're probably dating."

The words hung in the air between us.

"Ah." Nathan's voice was carefully neutral. "And that bothers you?"

"Does it bother you?"

"I asked first."

I forced myself to meet his eyes. "It doesn't bother me. The assumption, I mean. I just... I don't want people's gossip to make things weird between us."

"Things aren't weird between us." But something in his expression had shifted. More guarded.

"Right. No. Of course not." I picked up a brush, needing something to do with my hands. "Should we work on the showcase piece? We have four weeks left."

"Yeah. Let's work."

But the session felt different. We were both too aware now. When Nathan positioned himself near my canvas to watch my technique, I was conscious of how close he stood. When I leaned over to look at his sheet music, I noticed the exact moment our shoulders brushed.

The collaboration itself was flawless—we'd developed such synchronization that I could predict when he'd shift tempo and he could sense when I was about to change colors. But underneath the artistic harmony was a current of tension, unspoken and impossible to ignore.

At one point, Nathan reached to move my water jar out of his way at the exact same moment I reached for it. Our hands collided, fingers tangling briefly before we both jerked back.

"Sorry," we said simultaneously.

Our eyes met. Held. The studio suddenly felt very small, very private. We were alone on the third floor, the rest of the building dark and empty. Just us and the paint and music and everything we weren't saying.

Nathan broke the moment first, stepping back. "I should... I'll give you more space."

"You don't have to—"

"It's fine. Better angles for the improvisation anyway."

We worked for another hour, both of us carefully maintaining distance. The art was good—maybe our best work yet—but it felt like we were both holding our breath.

When midnight came, Nathan packed up quickly. More quickly than usual.

"Same time Tuesday?" he asked, not quite meeting my eyes.

"Same time."

He paused at the door. "Sienna?"

"Yeah?"

"I don't care what people say. About us, I mean. The gossip." He finally looked at me, and the intensity in his gaze made my breath catch. "What we're creating together—that's what matters. Not what other people think they see."

"Right. The art."

"The art," he agreed.

But as he left and I stood alone in the studio, surrounded by our collaborative canvases and the ghost of his music still hanging in the air, I couldn't shake the feeling that we were both lying.

It wasn't just about the art anymore.

Maybe it never had been.
