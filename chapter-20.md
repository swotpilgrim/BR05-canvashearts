# Chapter 20: The Impossible Choice

Nathan was late.

I'd been in the studio since 8:45, setting up for our Tuesday session. By 9:15, I started checking my phone. By 9:30, I was genuinely worried. In two months of collaboration, Nathan had never been late. Not once. Punctuality was practically his religion.

When he finally appeared at 9:40, I knew immediately something was wrong.

His hair was disheveled like he'd been running his hands through it repeatedly. His violin case hung from white-knuckled fingers. And his expression—controlled, careful Nathan—looked absolutely devastated.

"What happened?" I crossed to him immediately.

He set down his case with mechanical precision and pulled an envelope from his bag. The letterhead read "Berklee Conservatory of Music."

"They rescheduled my audition."

Relief flooded through me. "Oh. That's okay, right? You can just go on the new date—"

"December sixteenth. Saturday. Two o'clock." He met my eyes, and I saw the full weight of it. "The showcase is December sixteenth. Saturday evening. Seven o'clock."

The studio tilted slightly. December sixteenth. Three weeks from now. The winter showcase we'd been preparing for all semester, the project worth twenty percent of our grade, the collaboration that had consumed every Tuesday and Thursday night since September.

And Nathan's audition for his first-choice conservatory.

"How far is Berklee?" I asked, though I already knew it wouldn't matter.

"Four hours. The audition is scheduled for two o'clock. Check-in starts at one-thirty. Even if I left the second it ended—" He stopped, jaw tight. "I can't make both."

I sank onto the paint-splattered stool, processing. "Did you ask if you could reschedule again?"

"It's a reschedule already. They moved the original November date to accommodate more applicants." He pulled out a letter, hands shaking slightly. "All December audition slots are full. It's this date or I wait until the spring cycle."

"Which means—"

"Which means my application would be considered in the second round, after all the December auditioners. Significantly worse odds of acceptance or scholarship." He said it flatly, like reading a prison sentence. "My advisor says taking a spring slot instead of a December slot drops your chances by at least forty percent."

The numbers hung between us. Nathan had been preparing for this audition for years. Literally years. Every practice session, every competition, every summer program—all building toward conservatory applications. This was his future. His entire planned trajectory.

"Okay." I stood up, forcing my voice to stay calm. "Okay. You have to go to the audition."

"Sienna—"

"Nathan, listen to me." I walked over to him, trying to project certainty I didn't feel. "This is your dream. You've been working toward this since you were five years old. You're not throwing that away for one project."

"One project worth twenty percent of my grade. One project I committed to. One project with a partner who's been—" His voice cracked slightly. "You've been working just as hard as me. I can't just abandon you."

"You're not abandoning me. You're making the smart choice." My mind was already racing through possibilities. "I'll talk to Professor Reeves. Maybe I can do a solo performance. Paint to recorded music or something. Take whatever grade she gives me."

"That's not fair to you."

"Neither is asking you to give up your audition." I grabbed his hands, needing him to understand. "Nathan. This is Berklee. Your first choice. The conservatory your entire family expects you to get into. You cannot miss this audition because of a school project."

"This isn't just a school project." The words came out fierce, almost angry. "This collaboration—working with you—it's changed everything for me. How I think about music, about performance, about what kind of artist I want to be." He pulled his hands back, pacing now. "What does it say about me if I abandon that the second it conflicts with something more important?"

"It says you're being practical. Smart." I tried to sound convincing. "We always knew this project had an end date. The showcase was always just—"

"Don't." He stopped pacing, looking at me directly. "Don't minimize what we've created. What we've been creating."

The air felt thin. We weren't just talking about the art anymore. We both knew it.

"I'm not minimizing anything." My voice came out softer than intended. "I'm trying to give you permission to choose your future."

"By sacrificing yours? You'll fail the project."

"I'll take the hit. My portfolio's strong enough—the representatives loved it. One bad grade won't destroy my applications." I wasn't sure that was true, but I said it with conviction anyway. "You have to go to that audition."

Nathan looked at me for a long moment. Then he turned away, shoulders tight. "I need to talk to Professor Reeves. See if there are any options."

"Okay. Let's go now."

Professor Reeves's office in the arts building was dark, but we found her in the faculty lounge, grading papers with vicious red pen strokes.

"Brooks. Lawson." She looked up, taking in our expressions. "This doesn't look like a social visit."

Nathan explained the situation—the rescheduled audition, the conflict, the impossible timing. Professor Reeves listened without interrupting, her expression giving away nothing.

When he finished, she set down her pen. "That's unfortunate timing."

"Is there any way we could present on a different day?" I asked. "Or record our performance ahead of time?"

"The showcase is a live event. It's scheduled months in advance with visiting arts professionals attending. We don't do private presentations or recordings." She looked at Nathan. "I understand this puts you in a difficult position, but I can't make exceptions. Other students have auditions and conflicts too. If I accommodate one student, I have to accommodate all of them."

"What if I performed solo?" I offered. "Nathan could record his part, and I'd paint to it live—"

"The project is graded on collaboration. Mutual presence and response. That's the entire point." Professor Reeves's tone wasn't cruel, just matter-of-fact. "Mr. Brooks has a choice to make. Attend his audition and accept a failing grade on the project, or fulfill his commitment to the showcase and reschedule his audition to the spring cycle."

"Those aren't real choices," Nathan said quietly.

"They're difficult choices. But they're still choices." She looked between us. "This is part of being an artist. Sometimes opportunities conflict. Sometimes you have to decide what matters more at a specific moment in time. There's no right answer—just consequences you have to live with."

"So I either fail your class or tank my conservatory chances." Nathan's voice was hollow.

"You either prioritize this commitment or that one. Both are valid. But you can't have both." She picked up her pen again, a clear dismissal. "You have three weeks to decide. Let me know what you choose."

Outside her office, Nathan and I stood in the empty hallway, the weight of the decision crushing down.

"You're going to the audition," I said firmly. "I'm telling you right now, I won't let you sacrifice—"

"Don't tell me what to do, Sienna." He didn't say it meanly, but there was steel underneath. "This is my decision."

"Then make the smart one."

"The smart one?" He laughed bitterly. "The smart one is probably dropping out of Blackwood entirely and focusing exclusively on conservatory prep. The smart one would have never wasted time on an interdisciplinary project with a painter who throws chaos at canvas and calls it art."

The words stung, even though I knew they came from pain not malice.

"I should go," Nathan said abruptly. "I need to think."

"Nathan—"

But he was already walking away, violin case in hand, leaving me alone in the hallway.

I didn't go back to the studio. I went to my dorm, where Madison took one look at my face and pulled me into a hug.

"What happened?"

I told her everything. The audition conflict, Professor Reeves's non-negotiable policy, Nathan's impossible choice. By the time I finished, I was crying—angry, frustrated tears.

"He's going to choose the audition, right?" Madison asked. "I mean, obviously he has to."

"I told him to. But he's Nathan. He's probably going to torture himself with the decision for three weeks and then make himself miserable either way."

"What do you want him to choose?"

The question stopped me. What did I want?

I wanted him to go to Berklee and fulfill the dream he'd been working toward his entire life. I wanted him to become the musician he was meant to be. I wanted his future to be everything he'd planned.

But I also wanted him to stay. To finish what we'd started. To stand on stage with me in three weeks and create something beautiful together. To not disappear from my life the second it became complicated.

"I want him to be happy," I said finally.

"That's not an answer."

"It's the only answer I have."

Somewhere across campus, Nathan was probably in a practice room, trying to decide between the future he'd always planned and the partnership he'd never expected.

And I had no idea which one he'd choose.
