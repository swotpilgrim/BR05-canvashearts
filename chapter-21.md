# Chapter 21: When Perfection Isn't Enough

We didn't meet Thursday night.

Nathan sent a text Wednesday evening: *Need to focus on audition prep. Let's skip this week's sessions.*

I stared at the message for five full minutes before responding: *Of course. Good luck with practice.*

What I didn't text: *Please don't give up on us.*

What I didn't text: *I miss you already.*

What I didn't text: *Choose me.*

Because that would have been selfish. Because Nathan needed to make this decision without my feelings complicating it further. Because the right thing to do was let him go to that audition and build the future he'd always planned.

Even if it meant losing him.

Thursday night, I went to the studio anyway. Stood in front of our collaborative canvases, the physical evidence of two months' work. The evolution was visible—early pieces where our styles clashed, middle pieces where we found synchronization, recent work where we'd become something new together. Better together than either of us had been alone.

I picked up a brush and tried to work on a personal piece. Failed completely. Every brushstroke felt wrong without Nathan's music shaping the air around me.

Friday afternoon, I saw him across the dining hall. He was sitting with Ethan and the other music students, but he looked exhausted. Dark circles under his eyes, shoulders tight with tension. When our eyes met across the room, he looked away first.

Madison squeezed my hand under the table. "Give him time."

"What if time just means he's preparing to leave?"

"Then you'll deal with it. But torturing yourself with hypotheticals won't help."

Saturday I tried to give Nathan space. Focused on my own work, my art school applications, anything to distract myself from the Nathan-sized absence in my routine.

Sunday evening, I broke.

I found him in Practice Room 3B, the small space that had become familiar territory. Through the window I could see him working through scales, mechanical and precise. I knocked softly.

He looked up, surprised. Then he unlocked the door.

"Hi," I said inadequately.

"Hi." He set down his violin. "I'm sorry I cancelled Thursday. I just needed—"

"It's fine. I understand." I stepped inside, and he closed the door behind me. The practice room suddenly felt very small. "How's the audition prep going?"

"Fine. Good. I'm working on the required pieces—Bach Partita, the Brahms sonata, one contemporary work of my choosing." He said it like a recitation. "My technique is solid. I should be ready."

"That's good."

Silence stretched between us.

"Sienna—"

"Nathan—"

We both stopped. Nathan gestured for me to continue.

"I just wanted to say again that you should go to the audition. Without guilt. Without feeling like you're abandoning anything." I forced the words out. "This is your dream. You'd regret missing it."

"Would I?" He asked it quietly. "I'm not sure anymore what I'd regret more."

My heart was beating too fast. "What does that mean?"

"It means I've been practicing for six days straight, preparing these audition pieces, and they all sound lifeless. Technically perfect and emotionally dead." He picked up his violin, held it like it was something fragile. "Ethan said I sound like a robot again. Like I did before we started collaborating."

"You're just stressed. The pressure of the decision—"

"It's not stress, Sienna. It's that I don't want to be this person anymore." His voice was fierce now, urgent. "The person who chooses safety over risk. The person who prioritizes perfection over connection. The person who's so afraid of making mistakes that he never actually creates anything worth remembering."

"Going to your audition isn't choosing safety. It's choosing your future."

"Is it? Or is it choosing the future other people decided for me when I was five years old?" He set the violin down carefully. "My great-great-grandfather played for the Boston Symphony. My grandmother taught at Juilliard. My mother's a concert pianist. Of course I'd go to conservatory. Of course I'd pursue performance. No one ever asked if it's what I actually wanted."

"Is it?" I asked quietly. "What you want?"

Nathan was quiet for a long time. "I don't know. I used to be sure. Music was everything—the only thing I was good at, the only thing that made me special. But these past two months with you, I've realized I don't even know what I like about music anymore. I don't know if I enjoy playing or if I just enjoy being good at it."

"Nathan—"

"Working with you showed me what it feels like to create for the joy of creating. To take risks and be vulnerable and make something that comes from emotion not just technique." He looked at me, and the raw honesty in his expression made my chest ache. "If I go to that audition, if I choose Berklee and the path my family expects, I'm afraid I'll become that mechanical player again. The one who's technically flawless and artistically empty."

"You won't. You've changed. You can't unlearn what you've discovered."

"Can't I?" His laugh was bitter. "I've been practicing six days, Sienna. Six days without you, without our collaboration, without the freedom we built together. And I can already feel myself reverting. Playing it safe. Choosing precision over passion because precision is what conservatory judges want to hear."

I didn't know what to say. Because he was right—I'd heard it in his playing just now through the practice room window. The life had gone out of it.

"What if you went to the audition and played differently?" I suggested. "Played the way you've learned to play with me. With emotion and risk and—"

"They'd hate it. Conservatory auditions have rubrics. Technical proficiency, note accuracy, tempo control, dynamic range within acceptable parameters. They're not looking for innovation or emotional vulnerability. They're looking for perfection." He slumped against the wall. "Which is fine. That's the system. But it's not who I want to be anymore."

"Then don't be that person." I moved closer, desperate for him to understand. "Go to the audition and show them who you've become. If they don't accept you, then maybe it's not the right place."

"Easy to say when it's not your entire future on the line."

The words stung, but they were fair. I was asking him to risk everything he'd worked for based on two months of collaboration. That wasn't reasonable.

"You're right. I'm sorry. I shouldn't—" I backed toward the door. "I should let you practice."

"Sienna, wait." Nathan caught my hand. "I'm sorry. That wasn't fair. I'm just... I'm angry and confused and I don't know what to do."

"You don't have to decide right now. You have three weeks—"

"Three weeks to torture myself with an impossible choice?" He let go of my hand, running his fingers through his hair. "Go to the audition and lose the partnership that's meant more to me than anything in years? Or stay for the showcase and destroy my conservatory chances?"

Monday afternoon, I was in the studio working on a personal piece when Ethan appeared in the doorway.

"Can I talk to you?" he asked.

"Sure." I set down my brush, surprised. Ethan and I were friendly but not close—he was Nathan's person, not mine.

He came in, looking uncomfortable. "It's about Nathan."

"Is he okay?"

"No. Not really." Ethan leaned against the paint-splattered table. "He's been practicing obsessively since Wednesday. Like, eight hours a day. And it all sounds terrible."

"Terrible how?"

"Technically it's perfect. But it's lifeless. Mechanical. Like listening to a really advanced computer program play violin." Ethan met my eyes. "He sounds like he did freshman year before you two started working together. Before he learned how to actually feel music instead of just executing it."

"What do you want me to do about it?"

"I don't know. Talk to him? Tell him it's okay to choose the showcase? Tell him it's okay to choose the audition?" Ethan shook his head. "He's destroying himself trying to make this decision, and I think part of it is he's afraid of disappointing you."

"I've told him a hundred times to go to the audition. His future is more important than one project."

"Is that what you really think? Or is that what you think you're supposed to say?"

The question hit harder than expected. I turned back to my canvas, not wanting Ethan to see my expression. "What I think doesn't matter. This is Nathan's choice."

"It matters to him. You matter to him." Ethan's voice was gentle. "Look, I've known Nathan for two years. I've never seen him care about anything the way he cares about music. Until you. Until this collaboration. You changed something in him, showed him there's more to art than being perfect."

"So?"

"So maybe the reason he can't decide is because both choices feel like losing something essential. The audition represents his old life, his family's expectations, the future he's always planned. The showcase represents growth and partnership and becoming someone new." Ethan headed for the door, then paused. "For what it's worth, I think the Nathan who stays is the one I'd rather be friends with. But that's his decision to make."

After Ethan left, I sat alone in the studio for a long time.

Nathan was right about one thing: there was no good answer. Every choice had consequences he'd have to live with. And all I could do was support whatever he decided, even if it broke my heart.

Because somewhere in the past two months, between the late-night sessions and the shared breakthroughs and the comfortable silences, I'd fallen completely in love with Nathan Brooks.

And I had no idea if he felt the same way.
