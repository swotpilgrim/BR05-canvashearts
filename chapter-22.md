# Chapter 22: The Decision That Defines

Tuesday morning, Nathan sat in his dorm room with his phone in his hand and his violin case open on the bed.

The Berklee admissions number was already pulled up. One call. That's all it would take.

He'd been preparing what to say for three days. His finger hovered over the call button.

Everything he'd worked for since he was five years old was tied up in this audition. The hours of practice, the competitions, the summer programs. The expectations of five generations of musicians. The future that had been decided before he was old enough to question it.

But somewhere in the past ten weeks, that future had started feeling like someone else's life.

He thought about Sienna in the studio, paint-covered and passionate. The freedom of improvising without sheet music. The person he'd become when he let go of perfection long enough to actually feel something.

Walking away from the showcase meant choosing safety over growth. It meant proving that nothing he'd learned mattered when it conflicted with the comfortable path.

Nathan took a deep breath and pressed call.

"Berklee Conservatory admissions, this is Rachel speaking."

"Hi, my name is Nathan Brooks. I'm registered for the December sixteenth audition, two o'clock slot. I need to request a reschedule to the January cycle."

There was a pause. "Mr. Brooks, you're aware that January auditions are considered in the second application round? Your chances of acceptance and scholarship consideration would be significantly reduced."

"I understand."

"And you still want to reschedule?"

Nathan looked at his violin. At the sheet music spread across his desk. At the person he'd been before Sienna showed him there was more to music than technical perfection.

"Yes. I still want to reschedule."

"Alright. I have a slot available on January twentieth at ten a.m. Will that work?"

"That's perfect. Thank you."

When he hung up, Nathan sat in silence for a long moment. He'd done it. Made the choice that would probably disappoint his family, lower his conservatory chances, complicate his entire future.

And he felt lighter than he had in days.

---

I arrived at the studio Tuesday evening with my heart in my throat.

Nathan had texted that morning: *Can we meet tonight? Regular time?*

Just that. No context. No indication of what he'd decided.

I'd spent the entire day preparing myself for goodbye. He'd made his choice—the smart choice, the practical choice—and tonight would be our last session. We'd figure out some graceful way to end the collaboration. He'd go to his audition. I'd take the failing grade. We'd both move on with our separate lives.

I'd cried about it in the shower that morning. Now I was just numb.

When I walked into the studio at nine, Nathan was already there, setting up his music stand. He looked different somehow. The tension that had made his shoulders tight for the past week was gone.

"Hey," he said softly.

"Hey." I set down my bag, not quite meeting his eyes. If I looked at him too directly, I'd start crying again. "So. We should probably talk about how to handle the next few weeks. I can work on a solo piece for the showcase, and you can focus on—"

"Sienna."

Something in his voice made me stop.

"I'm not going to the audition."

I stared at him, certain I'd misheard. "What?"

"I called Berklee this morning. Rescheduled for January twentieth." He said it calmly, like it was already decided and settled. "So I'll be here for the showcase. If you still want to work together."

"You—" I couldn't process the words. "You rescheduled? Your first-choice conservatory?"

"To the January cycle, yes."

"Nathan, no. You can't—" Panic was rising in my chest. "You said the January slots are less favorable. You said it drops your chances by forty percent. You've been working toward this for years, you can't just—"

"I can. I did." He moved closer, his expression open in a way I'd never seen. "I made the choice, Sienna. And before you argue, before you try to talk me out of it, I need you to understand why."

"Your future—"

"Let me finish." It wasn't harsh, just firm. "Please."

I closed my mouth, nodding.

Nathan took a breath. "When I got that rescheduling letter last week, I thought my choice was between the audition and the showcase. Between my future and one school project. But that's not actually what I was choosing between."

"Then what—"

"I was choosing between the person I've always been and the person I want to become." He said it with quiet certainty. "The old Nathan would have gone without question. Would have prioritized safety and expectations. Would have valued perfection over growth or connection."

"But that audition is important—"

"The audition is still happening. Just five weeks later." Nathan picked up his violin, held it like something precious. "These past two months working with you have changed me fundamentally. You showed me what it means to create art that comes from emotion, not fear. You taught me that discipline without passion is empty. That the best work requires vulnerability and risk and trusting yourself even when you're terrified."

My throat was tight. "Nathan—"

"If I walked away from this showcase—from you, from this partnership—to go to an audition where I'd play it safe and perform technically perfect pieces with zero emotional honesty, what would that say? That I learned nothing? That growth only matters when it's convenient?" He shook his head. "I can't do that. I won't."

"But your family. Their expectations—"

"Are their expectations, not mine." For the first time, he said it without guilt or apology. "I've spent eighteen years trying to be the musician they needed me to be. Maybe it's time I figure out who I actually am as an artist."

I was crying now, couldn't help it. "You're willing to risk your conservatory chances for a school project?"

"I'm not risking my chances for a project, Sienna." Nathan stepped closer, and the intensity in his gaze made my breath catch. "I'm choosing to be the kind of person who honors his commitments. Who values partnership over individual success. Who believes that some things—growth, integrity, the people who help you become who you're meant to be—matter more than following the easiest path."

"I don't want you to regret this."

"The only thing I'd regret is walking away." His voice dropped, more vulnerable. "This collaboration—working with you—it's the first time in years that music has felt like something other than a test I'm trying to pass. You've given me back the joy I forgot existed. How could I abandon that the second it becomes inconvenient?"

"What if you don't get into Berklee because of this? What if the January audition—"

"Then I'll apply to other conservatories. Or I'll major in music at a regular university. Or I'll figure out something else entirely." He smiled slightly. "For the first time in my life, I'm not terrified of deviating from the plan. Because you showed me that the best things aren't planned—they happen when you're brave enough to take risks."

I couldn't speak. Could barely breathe. Nathan had just rearranged his entire future to stay here, to finish what we'd started, to choose growth over safety.

To choose me.

"So," Nathan set down his violin and looked at me directly. "If you're still willing to work together, I'd like to finish this showcase piece. Make it the best thing either of us has ever created. Show Blackwood what genuine collaboration looks like."

"You're sure?" I needed to hear him say it one more time.

"I've never been more sure of anything."

The relief that flooded through me was so intense it was almost painful. "Okay. Yes. Let's work."

Nathan smiled—a real smile that reached his eyes. "Good. Because I've been thinking about our final piece all week, and I have some ideas."

We spent the next three hours working with an intensity and focus we'd never achieved before. Nathan's playing had transformed again—not mechanical, not safe, but emotional and honest and free. He improvised with the confidence of someone who'd made peace with risk.

And I painted with a joy that came from more than just the art. From knowing he'd chosen to stay. From understanding what that choice meant.

The piece we created that night was beautiful and raw and completely vulnerable. It captured not just our individual styles but the partnership we'd built—the way we'd challenged and changed each other, the way we'd learned to balance structure and spontaneity, control and release.

When we finally stopped at midnight, both of us exhausted and exhilarated, Nathan looked at the canvas we'd created and then at me.

"Thank you," he said quietly.

"For what?"

"For giving me permission to become someone different. Someone better."

"You did that yourself. I just—"

"You showed me it was possible." He was standing close now, close enough that I could see the exact green of his eyes, the paint smudge I'd accidentally gotten on his collar. "I wouldn't be this person without you."

The studio suddenly felt very small, very intimate. Just us and the art we'd created and everything we weren't quite saying.

"Nathan," I started, not sure how to finish.

He smiled, reading the uncertainty. "We should probably focus on the showcase. Three weeks isn't a lot of time."

"Right. The showcase. Yes." I stepped back, breaking the moment. "Same time Thursday?"

"I'll be here."

As I packed up my supplies and Nathan cleaned rosin off his violin, I couldn't stop thinking about what he'd done. The choice he'd made. The future he'd risked for partnership and growth and the possibility of becoming someone new.

For me.

And I had absolutely no idea what to do with that knowledge except paint it into every canvas and hope he could read between the brushstrokes what I wasn't brave enough to say out loud.
