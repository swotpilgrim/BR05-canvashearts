# Chapter 25: The Night Before

Friday night—the night before the showcase—Willoughby Hall was booked solid with other interdisciplinary teams doing final rehearsals. Madison had tried to secure us a slot, but every time block was taken.

"Studio it is," I texted Nathan. *Midnight? After everyone else clears out?*

*Perfect. See you then.*

I spent the evening in a state of nervous energy. This was it—our last rehearsal before tomorrow's performance. After three months of work, countless hours in the studio, the crisis of the audition conflict, the breakthrough of vulnerability, it all came down to fifteen minutes on stage.

Everything we'd built, everything we felt, everything we'd been too afraid to say—visible for everyone to see.

I was terrified and exhilarated in equal measure.

When I arrived at the studio at 11:45, Nathan was already there, sitting on the paint-splattered floor with his back against the wall, violin case beside him. He looked up as I entered.

"Couldn't sleep either?" I asked.

"Too wired." He patted the floor beside him. "Madison texted me. Willoughby Hall is chaos—apparently two teams got into an argument about setup time."

"Glad we're here then." I sat down next to him, our shoulders touching. The studio felt different at midnight—quieter, more intimate. Just us and the canvases documenting our three-month journey.

"Should we run through the piece?" Nathan asked.

"In a minute. I'm not ready yet."

So we sat in comfortable silence, the kind we'd developed over weeks of late-night sessions. Outside the windows, Blackwood campus was dark and still. Inside the studio, the overhead lights cast everything in warm tones.

"Are you nervous about tomorrow?" Nathan asked quietly.

"Completely terrified. You?"

"Same." He picked up his violin, held it in his lap. "I keep thinking about the piece we're about to perform. How honest it is. How visible."

"Having regrets?"

"No." He said it firmly. "Just... aware. Of what we're revealing."

"We could go back to the safe version," I offered, though I didn't want to. "The dress rehearsal piece was good enough for an A."

"I don't want good enough." Nathan looked at me. "I want the truth. Even if it's scary."

"Then let's practice being scared together."

We stood and set up our performance space. Nathan positioned himself with his violin. I arranged my paint supplies beside the six-foot canvas. The studio was quiet except for the sound of our preparation.

"Ready?" I asked.

"As I'll ever be."

Nathan began to play.

Even in rehearsal, even alone in the studio, the vulnerability of our piece made my chest tight. He played our story with such honesty—the hesitation, the conflict, the gradual trust, the breakthrough. And I painted it, translating emotion into color and form.

We moved through our fifteen minutes with the synchronization of three months' practice. The music shaped my brushstrokes. My painting influenced his improvisation. We were creating something that neither of us could have made alone.

When Nathan played the final note and I set down my brush, we both stood breathing hard, looking at what we'd created.

"It's ready," Nathan said quietly.

"Yeah. It is."

The canvas captured everything—the journey, the growth, the connection we'd built. Tomorrow, three hundred people would see it. Tomorrow, there would be no more hiding.

But tonight, it was just ours.

Neither of us moved to clean up. Instead, we gravitated back to the floor, sitting with our backs against the wall, shoulders touching.

"We should probably sleep," Nathan said without conviction.

"Probably." I didn't move either.

Silence stretched between us, comfortable and charged at once.

"Can I ask you something?" Nathan turned slightly toward me. "What are you hoping for with art school? Not which one you get into, but what you want your future to look like."

The question surprised me with its intimacy. "I want to keep creating art that means something. Not just technically good work, but pieces that come from honest emotion." I thought about it. "I want to find a community of artists who push each other to grow. People who challenge my assumptions the way you've challenged mine."

"You'll find that. Your work is remarkable—any program would be lucky to have you."

"What about you? What do you want from conservatory?"

Nathan was quiet for a moment. "Three months ago, I would have said I wanted to perfect my technique, get into a top orchestra, build a performance career like my family expects." He smiled slightly. "Now I'm not sure. I still love music—that hasn't changed. But I want to play music that actually means something. That connects with people emotionally, not just impresses them technically."

"You will. That's who you've become."

"Because of you." He said it simply, like fact. "Before we started collaborating, I hadn't enjoyed playing in years. Now I can't imagine music without that joy, that emotional honesty you showed me."

My throat was tight. "You did the same for me. Taught me that discipline enhances spontaneity, that planning doesn't kill creativity. I'm a better artist because of these three months."

"So we saved each other from ourselves."

"Apparently."

We sat in silence again, aware of how close we were sitting, how much we'd just acknowledged. The almost-three-months of partnership hung between us, all the late nights and breakthroughs and careful dancing around what we felt.

"Remember our first meeting?" I asked. "In Practice Room 3B? You thought I was chaotic and undisciplined."

Nathan laughed quietly. "And you thought I was uptight and mechanical."

"We were both right."

"And both wrong." He shifted slightly, his shoulder pressing more firmly against mine. "I'm glad Professor Reeves assigned us together. Even though I was horrified at the time."

"Me too. This collaboration—" I searched for words. "It's been the most important thing I've done at Blackwood."

"For me too."

The air between us shifted, became heavier. We were sitting so close I could count his heartbeats in the pulse visible at his throat. Could see the exact green of his eyes in the studio lighting. Could feel the warmth of his shoulder against mine.

Nathan turned his head, and suddenly we were face to face. Inches apart.

"Sienna," he said softly.

My heart was racing. "Yeah?"

"Tomorrow—" He stopped, started again. "After the showcase, after we perform this piece that reveals everything we've been not-saying for three months, we should probably actually talk about—"

"About what we mean to each other," I finished quietly.

"Yes."

I wanted to kiss him. The impulse was overwhelming. We were alone in the studio at midnight, sitting close enough that I could feel his breath, aware of each other in ways that had nothing to do with art.

But tomorrow felt too important. Too significant. Kissing him now would complicate everything—the performance, the vulnerability, the truth we were about to expose on stage.

"After the showcase," I said. "Let's talk after."

Nathan nodded slowly, understanding. "After."

But neither of us moved. We sat there in the charged silence, both of us aware of the almost-kiss, the feelings we were admitting without speaking, the future conversation we'd just promised each other.

"We should probably get some sleep," Nathan said again.

"Probably."

Still, we didn't move. Didn't want to break the moment.

Finally, reluctantly, Nathan stood and offered me his hand. I took it, and he pulled me to my feet. We were standing close—closer than necessary—both of us caught in the gravity of what tomorrow meant.

"I should walk you back to your dorm," he said.

"It's 2 a.m. I can walk myself."

"I know you can. I want to anyway."

So we walked across the dark campus together, shoulder to shoulder, not quite holding hands but close enough that our fingers brushed with every step. The December air was cold, and I could see my breath in small clouds.

At my dorm entrance, we stopped.

"Goodnight, Sienna."

"Goodnight, Nathan."

Neither of us moved to leave.

"Tomorrow," Nathan said quietly, "when we perform that piece in front of everyone we know—I just want you to know that I don't regret any of it. The honesty, the vulnerability, what we're revealing. I don't regret choosing this partnership over the safe path."

"Neither do I."

"Good." He smiled slightly. "See you tomorrow. Seven o'clock, backstage."

"I'll be there."

I watched him walk away across the quad, violin case in hand, until he disappeared into the darkness. Then I went inside, where Madison was waiting in our room.

"How did it go?" she asked immediately.

I sank onto my bed, suddenly exhausted and exhilarated. "The piece is ready."

"And?"

"And we almost kissed but decided to wait until after the showcase."

Madison grinned. "You two are ridiculously romantic, you know that?"

"We're terrified."

"That too." She came and sat beside me. "But you're doing it anyway. Performing this incredibly honest piece that reveals everything you feel. That takes guts."

"Or stupidity."

"Sometimes those are the same thing." Madison squeezed my hand. "Get some sleep. Tomorrow you're going to stand on that stage and create something beautiful and true, and then you're going to finally tell that boy you love him."

"I never said—"

"Sienna. Please. You've been in love with him since October. Maybe earlier."

I wanted to deny it, but Madison was right. Somewhere between the reluctant first meeting and tonight's midnight rehearsal, I'd fallen completely in love with Nathan Brooks.

Tomorrow, in front of three hundred people, I'd paint that truth onto a six-foot canvas while he played it into the air.

And then, after the applause faded and the audience left and it was just us again, we'd finally say out loud what we'd been expressing through art for weeks.

I was terrified.

I couldn't wait.
