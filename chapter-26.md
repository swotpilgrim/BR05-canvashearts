# Chapter 26: Showcase Night

I woke up Saturday morning with my stomach in knots.

Showcase day.

Madison was already awake, sitting at her desk with coffee and a determined expression. "Okay. Today's schedule. Breakfast, then you're going to take a long shower and actually relax. This afternoon we'll do a final equipment check at Willoughby Hall. Your call time is 6:30 p.m., performance at 7:45."

"I'm going to throw up."

"You're going to be brilliant." She handed me coffee. "Drink. Eat. Breathe. You've practiced this piece thirty times. You're ready."

I wasn't sure I'd ever be ready to stand on stage and expose my feelings in front of three hundred people. But Madison was right—there was no backing out now.

The day passed in a blur of nervous energy. I couldn't eat lunch. Couldn't focus on anything. At 4 p.m., I met Madison at Willoughby Hall for setup check.

The hall had been transformed. The stage was lit professionally, with spotlights positioned for performers. Rows of seats stretched back into darkness. A printed program listed all the interdisciplinary teams—twelve performances total, spanning music and dance, sculpture and theater, photography and spoken word.

Our names appeared halfway through: *Nathan Brooks (violin) and Sienna Lawson (visual art) - "Untitled Collaboration."*

We hadn't named our piece. It felt too personal for a title.

Madison directed the tech crew as they positioned the canvas easel at the precise angle we'd practiced. The six-foot blank canvas looked enormous under the stage lights.

"Paint supplies cart here," Madison instructed, pointing. "Violin mic positioned center stage. Spotlight one on Nathan, spotlight two on canvas, general wash for Sienna to see her work."

I watched her orchestrate everything with quiet gratitude. "Thank you for doing this."

"Are you kidding? I live for this stuff." She grinned. "Plus, I want your performance to be perfect so everyone can see what you two have been creating for three months."

At 6:30, I arrived backstage in my paint-stained jeans and a black shirt Madison had insisted looked "artistically serious." My hands were shaking as I organized paint tubes for the tenth time.

Other interdisciplinary teams filled the backstage area—dancers stretching, musicians warming up, artists checking supplies. The nervous energy was contagious.

Nathan appeared at 6:45, violin case in hand, wearing dark slacks and a deep green sweater that made his eyes impossible to ignore. When he saw me, his expression softened.

"Hey," he said quietly.

"Hey yourself." I tried to smile. "Ready to expose our entire emotional journey to everyone we know?"

"Completely terrified. You?"

"Same."

Ethan materialized beside Nathan. "Dude. The house is packed. I just saw Dean Caldwell and like six visiting professionals in the front row."

"That's not helping," Nathan said, but there was amusement underneath.

Madison found us in the backstage chaos. "Okay, you two. You're on in forty-five minutes. The dance-poetry piece is performing now, then there's one more team, then you."

My stomach dropped. "Forty-five minutes."

"You've got this." Madison squeezed my shoulders. "Both of you. Trust yourselves, trust each other, and create what you've been creating for three months. It's already brilliant—you just need to show everyone else."

Nathan and I found a quiet corner backstage to wait. We sat on the floor, backs against the wall, close enough that our shoulders touched. I could hear the muffled sound of performances from the stage, the periodic applause.

"My parents are out there," I said quietly. "Front row. My mom texted that they're excited."

"Mine too. My mother flew in from Connecticut." Nathan's voice was tight. "She hasn't seen me perform in two years."

"No pressure."

"None at all." He reached over and took my hand, threading our fingers together. "We're going to be amazing."

The simple contact steadied me. "Together."

"Together," he agreed.

A stage manager appeared. "Brooks and Lawson? You're next. Please head to stage left."

This was it.

We stood, still holding hands, and made our way to the wings. From here I could see the stage—the canvas waiting under lights, Nathan's microphone positioned precisely, our performance space ready.

Beyond the stage lights, I could see the dark mass of the audience. Three hundred people waiting to watch us create.

The current team finished their piece—something involving sculpture and flute—to enthusiastic applause. They exited stage right, faces flushed with success.

The stage manager looked at us. "You're on. Break legs."

Nathan and I walked onto the stage together.

The lights were bright, making it hard to see individual faces in the audience. But I could feel them—three hundred people watching, waiting. I spotted Madison in the third row, giving me a thumbs up. My parents beside her. Nathan's elegant mother in the front row, expression unreadable.

We took our positions. Nathan center stage with his violin. Me beside the massive blank canvas, paint supplies within reach.

The stage lights dimmed slightly—our cue.

Nathan and I looked at each other across the stage. Three months of collaboration, conflict, growth, and unspoken feelings condensed into this moment. He raised his violin. I picked up my first brush.

And we began.

Nathan's first notes were hesitant, questioning—the sound of our tentative first meeting. I responded with sharp, contrasting brushstrokes in red and blue, colors that clashed deliberately.

The audience disappeared. There was only the music and the canvas and the story we were telling.

Nathan's playing grew more confident as I painted our gradual synchronization. The music explored different themes—classical phrases giving way to improvisation, structure melting into freedom. I painted the evolution, bold strokes of color beginning to interact and complement rather than fight.

We moved through our journey. The breakthrough moment when Nathan first improvised became an explosion of integrated color and sound. The painting captured movement and energy, forms dancing together rather than competing.

Then the music softened, became more intimate. Nathan played our late-night sessions, the quiet conversations, the growing understanding. I painted with smaller, more deliberate strokes—the details of connection, the intimacy of collaboration.

The piece built to the crisis. Nathan's playing conveyed conflict and decision, the impossible choice between safety and growth. The painting showed fracture and tension, pulled between opposing forces.

And then the resolution. Nathan's violin sang with the freedom of choosing vulnerability over perfection. With the joy of finding partnership that enhanced rather than limited. I painted the synthesis—colors and forms that balanced structure and spontaneity, discipline and passion, his influence and mine woven together inseparably.

The final movement was pure emotion. Nathan played everything we'd been too afraid to say—the gratitude, the connection, the feelings we'd hidden behind artistic collaboration. And I painted it, translating emotion into visual language.

This was us. The truth of what we'd built together. The people we'd become through challenging and changing each other.

When Nathan played his final note—sustained and achingly beautiful—I set down my brush.

The silence in Willoughby Hall was absolute.

I turned to look at the canvas. Six feet of raw emotional honesty. The visual representation of three months that had changed both of us fundamentally.

Then the applause began.

It started with a few people and built like a wave. The audience rose to their feet—students, faculty, professionals, parents. The sound was overwhelming.

Nathan and I stood on stage, slightly dazed, as three hundred people applauded our vulnerability. Madison was crying in the third row. Ethan was grinning. My mother had her hand over her heart. Nathan's mother was standing, clapping with an expression of surprise and pride.

Dean Caldwell was nodding with clear approval. Professor Reeves was actually smiling.

We'd done it. Created something true and vulnerable and beautiful.

Nathan and I looked at each other across the stage, and in his expression I saw everything—pride, relief, exhilaration, and something deeper. Something we'd been painting and playing around for weeks but never saying directly.

We took our bows as the applause continued. Then the stage manager was ushering us off to make room for the next performance.

Backstage, still high on adrenaline, we were mobbed immediately.

"That was incredible!" One of the dance students hugged me. "I was crying."

"Your synchronization was perfect," a music major told Nathan. "How many hours did you rehearse?"

But Nathan and I barely heard the congratulations. We were looking at each other through the backstage chaos, both of us aware that we'd just revealed everything to everyone.

No more hiding. No more dancing around the truth.

Now came the hard part: actually talking about it.

Madison appeared and grabbed my arm. "The reception is starting in the hall lobby. Your parents want to congratulate you both. Come on."

As we were pulled toward the lobby and the crowd of well-wishers, Nathan caught my hand briefly. "After," he said quietly. "After all of this, we talk."

"Promise."

"Promise."

But first we had to survive the reception, the congratulations, the analysis of our performance from people who'd just watched us expose our hearts on stage.

And I had absolutely no idea how to pretend that piece had been just about artistic collaboration when everyone in that audience had seen the truth.

We'd fallen for each other.

And now everyone knew it.
