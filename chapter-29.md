# Chapter 29: New Beginnings

Sunday morning sunlight streamed through the dining hall windows, bright and hopeful.

I walked in with Madison at 10 a.m., still half-asleep but floating on the afterglow of last night. The showcase, the confession, the kisses in the studio—all of it felt like a dream.

"There he is," Madison said, pointing.

Nathan sat at our usual table with Ethan, both of them with coffee and breakfast. When Nathan saw me, his whole face lit up with that unguarded smile I'd learned to treasure.

I slid into the seat beside him, and without hesitation, he took my hand. Right there in the dining hall where everyone could see.

"Morning," he said softly.

"Morning." I was probably blushing, but I didn't care.

Madison sat across from us with a smug grin. "So. You two finally figured it out."

"We did," I confirmed.

"Thank god. The sexual tension was killing everyone." She laughed at our expressions. "Oh please, you've been making eyes at each other for months. Half the school had bets on when you'd finally get together."

Ethan raised his coffee mug. "I won fifty bucks. I had 'immediately after the showcase.' Nathan, you made me proud."

Nathan groaned. "You bet on us?"

"Everyone bet on you. The music department pool was extensive." Ethan grinned. "But seriously, I'm happy for you both. You're good together."

Other students at nearby tables were definitely watching us, whispering. The campus gossip mill would be in full effect by lunchtime. But I found I didn't care. Let them talk. We'd already exposed our feelings to three hundred people—there was no going back to hiding.

"How was the after-party in the studio?" Madison asked innocently.

"We talked," I said primly. "About the collaboration project and our feelings about it."

"And made out a little," Nathan added, deadpan.

I choked on my orange juice. Madison cackled. Even Ethan looked impressed.

"Okay, I like this version of Nathan," Ethan said. "The one who makes jokes and holds hands and looks actually happy instead of stressed all the time."

"I learned from the best," Nathan said, squeezing my hand.

We ate breakfast surrounded by friends and campus attention, and it felt natural. Right. Like this was who we were supposed to be—together, publicly, not hiding behind the excuse of a project anymore.

But as breakfast wound down and conversation turned to finals week starting tomorrow, reality began creeping in.

"So," Madison said carefully. "What happens now? With you two?"

Nathan and I looked at each other. We'd talked about this briefly in the studio at 3 a.m., but not in detail.

"Spring semester starts in January," I said slowly. "I have art school applications due. Nathan has his audition—"

"January twentieth," Nathan confirmed. "Three weeks from yesterday."

"Are you nervous?" Ethan asked. "About the audition?"

"Less than I was." Nathan's thumb traced circles on the back of my hand. "I mean, yes, I'm nervous. But it's not paralyzing anymore. I know what I want to say musically. I know who I am as an artist now."

"You're going to be amazing," I said with absolute certainty.

"What about you?" Madison turned to me. "Art school applications?"

"Due mid-January. I'm applying to three programs—one in Philadelphia, one in Boston, one in New York." I took a breath. "My portfolio is strong. The representatives at the showcase asked for my contact information. I think I have a real shot."

"You absolutely do," Nathan said. "Any program would be lucky to have you."

The unspoken reality hung between us. Three schools in three different cities. And Nathan's conservatory options were scattered across the country—Boston, New York, San Francisco, Chicago.

The chances of us ending up in the same city were slim.

"Long distance," Madison said quietly, reading our expressions.

"If it comes to that," Nathan agreed.

"And if it does?" Ethan asked. "What's the plan?"

Nathan looked at me. "We make it work. Whatever that looks like."

"You're sure?" I needed to hear him say it. "Long distance is hard. And we've only been together—" I checked my watch "—approximately twelve hours."

"Thirteen," Nathan corrected with a slight smile. "Since you kissed me in the studio at 11 p.m."

"Okay, thirteen hours. That's not a lot of time to be making promises about the future."

"It's been three months," Nathan countered. "Three months of learning how you think, how you create, what you need, what scares you. Three months of late-night conversations and shared breakthroughs and figuring out how to balance my structure with your spontaneity." He turned to face me fully. "Thirteen hours as a couple, maybe. But three months as partners. That's enough to know this matters."

My throat was tight. "It does matter."

"So we figure it out. Visit each other on weekends when we can. Call and video chat. Keep collaborating remotely if we have to." Nathan's voice was determined. "You taught me that the best art comes from challenge and compromise. I think relationships are the same."

"Very wise," Madison said approvingly. "See? You two are already good at this."

"We've had practice," I pointed out. "Three months of navigating creative differences."

"And look how that turned out," Ethan gestured between us. "You created the best showcase piece anyone's ever seen and fell in love. Seems like good precedent."

After breakfast, Nathan and I walked across campus together. The December air was crisp and bright, campus quiet with most students sleeping off their Saturday nights.

"Do you really think we can make it work?" I asked as we walked. "If we end up in different cities?"

"I think we have to try." Nathan stopped walking, turning to face me. "Sienna, I rescheduled my conservatory audition for you. Chose this partnership over the safe path. You showed me what it means to take risks for something that matters."

"This matters?"

"You matter." He said it with complete certainty. "More than the convenient choice. More than the easy path."

I kissed him right there in the middle of the quad, not caring who saw.

When we broke apart, both smiling, Nathan took my hand and we kept walking.

"Spring semester," he said. "We keep creating together. Keep challenging each other. Support each other through applications and auditions."

"And whatever happens—whatever cities we end up in—we commit to making it work."

"Deal."

We reached the arts building and climbed to the third-floor studio out of habit. The space looked different in daylight—less intimate than our late-night sessions, but still ours.

The canvas from last night's performance leaned against the wall, paint fully dry now. Looking at it in the clear morning light, I could see exactly what we'd created.

The journey from conflict to collaboration. From individual artists to genuine partnership. The visual representation of falling in love while learning to create together.

"We should start a new piece," Nathan suggested. "Now that we don't have the pressure of a grade or a showcase deadline."

"What would we create?"

"I don't know. Something that shows who we are now. After everything." He pulled me close, arms around my waist. "Something that captures this moment—terrified about the future but choosing to risk it anyway."

"That's very abstract."

"You'll figure it out. You always do." He kissed my forehead. "I'll just play whatever emotions I'm feeling and trust you to make them visible."

"That's basically our entire process."

"It works."

We stood in the studio where our partnership had been forced to begin, where we'd argued and collaborated and gradually fallen for each other. Where we'd learned that the best art comes from vulnerability. That growth requires challenging each other. That discipline and spontaneity aren't opposites—they're partners.

Spring semester would bring applications and auditions and uncertainty. We'd probably end up in different cities, navigating the complications of long distance and demanding programs.

But we'd also keep creating together. Keep pushing each other to grow. Keep choosing vulnerability over safety, risk over the comfortable path.

"Same time Tuesday?" Nathan asked, echoing last night.

"Actually," I said, "why wait? Let's work this afternoon. Start our new collaboration."

"I have orchestra rehearsal at three."

"Then tonight. Nine p.m. Our usual time."

Nathan smiled. "I like that we have a usual time."

"I like that we have an us."

We kissed again, unhurried and sweet, surrounded by canvases documenting our growth. Outside the windows, Blackwood campus spread beneath winter sun—the beginning of our last semester here before everything changed.

It was terrifying.

It was exhilarating.

And I couldn't wait to see what we'd create next.
